This can be particularly useful when dealing with many features, as fewer dimensions make the regression algorithm less prone to overfitting.\n",

        "* **Reduced Overfitting Tendencies:** By removing redundant and highly correlated variables, PCA can help reduce the risk of overfitting by focusing the model on the most influential features.\n",

        "* A **high negative loading score** indicates that the variable is negatively correlated with the principal component, meaning it varies in the opposite direction.\n",

        "\n",
        "The `model_factors` regression model is based on factor analysis, which reduces the dimensionality of the input data by transforming the original variables into a smaller group of uncorrelated factors. These factors are linear combinations of the original variables and are designed to capture the underlying structure of the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Factors:** Instead of using the original variables, the regression is performed on the extracted factors. Each factor represents a weighted combination of the original variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Coefficients:** The coefficients in the `model_factors` regression model indicate the relationship between the target variable (`y`) and the extracted factors.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Differences Compared to the Standard OLS Model\n",
        "\n",
        "**Input Variables:**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **OLS Model (`model`):** Uses the original variables (`X_encoded`) as predictors.\n",
        "- **Factor Analysis Model (`model_factors`):** Uses the extracted factors (`df_factors`) as predictors.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Multicollinearity:**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **OLS Model:** Can suffer from multicollinearity if the predictors are highly correlated, leading to unstable coefficients and inflated standard errors.\n",
        "- **Factor Analysis Model:** Reduces multicollinearity by using uncorrelated factors as predictors.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Interpretability:**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **OLS Model:** Coefficients correspond directly to the original variables, making it easier to interpret the influence of each variable on the target variable.\n",
        "- **Factor Analysis Model:** Coefficients relate to abstract factors, which are combinations of the original variables, making interpretation more challenging.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Dimensionality:**\n",

        "- **OLS Model:** Uses all original variables, which may include redundant or irrelevant features.\n",

        "### Advantages of Using `model_factors`\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Reduced Multicollinearity:** By using uncorrelated factors, the model avoids instability caused by multicollinearity.\n",

        "\n",
        "### Disadvantages of Using `model_factors`\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Loss of Interpretability:** Factors are abstract combinations of the original variables, making it harder to directly interpret the coefficients. To understand the influence of individual variables on the target variable, factor loadings must be analyzed.\n",
        "- **Potential Information Loss:** If too few factors are retained, information from the original variables may be lost, reducing predictive accuracy.\n",
        "- **Complexity:** The process of extracting factors and interpreting their meaning adds complexity to the modeling process.\n",
        "- **Dependence on Factor Selection:** The number of factors to retain is subjective and can affect model performance. Too few factors may oversimplify the data, while too many factors may reintroduce multicollinearity.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Summary\n",
        "\n",
        "- `model_factors` is a good choice when multicollinearity is a problem and the focus is on predictive performance rather than interpretability.\n",
