        "The concepts of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Factor Analysis (FA) are both  dimensionality reduction techniques. They operate on different assumptions and serve distinct purposes.\n",
        "PCA aims to transform correlated variables into a smaller set of uncorrelated principal components that capture maximum variance, whereas Factor Analysis seeks to explain the correlations between observed variables in terms of a smaller number of unobserved, underlying factors. \n",
        "\n",
        "After loading and preprocessing the data in @sec-data-preprocessing, we will explore these methods to reduce dimensions and address multicollinearity. In @sec-fit-ols we will conduct linear regression on the extracted components or factors.\n",
        "@sec-collinearity-diagnostics provides diagnostics for multicollinearity, including the coefficient table, eigenvalues, condition indices, and the KMO measure. \n",
        "@sec-pca explains how PCA is applied to the data, while @sec-fa discusses Factor Analysis. Both methods are used to mitigate multicollinearity issues in regression models. @sec-other-models shows how the reduced dimensions can be used in other machine learning models, such as Random Forests.\n",

PCA is primarily used for data compression and simplifying complex datasets.\n",

        "\n",

        "*   **Reducing Multicollinearity:** PCA effectively eliminates multicollinearity in linear regression models because the resulting principal components are orthogonal (uncorrelated) to each other, leading to more stable coefficient estimates.\n",
        "*   **Handling High-Dimensional Data:** It can reduce the dimensions of datasets with many variables to a manageable level before regression.\n",
        "*   **Reduced Overfitting Tendencies:** By removing redundant and highly correlated variables, PCA helps reduce the risk of overfitting by focusing the model on the most influential features.\n",
        "*   **Improved Model Performance:** Performing regression on the most important principal components often leads to better generalization and improved model performance on new data.\n",
