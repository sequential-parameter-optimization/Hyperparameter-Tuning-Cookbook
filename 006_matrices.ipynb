Recall that the element in the $k$-th row and $i$-th column of the transpose matrix $\\mathbf{A}^T$ is $(A^T)_{ki} = a_{ik}$. So, $\\sum_{i=1}^n a_{ik} v_i = \\sum_{i=1}^n (A^T)_{ki} v_i$, which is the $k$-th component of the matrix-vector product $\\mathbf{A}^T \\mathbf{v}$.\n",

Assemble the gradient vector: The $k$-th component of the gradient $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\mathbf{v}} (\\mathbf{v}^T \\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{v})$ is $(\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{v})_k + (\\mathbf{A}^T \\mathbf{v})_k$. Since this holds for all $k = 1, \\dots, n$, the gradient vector is the sum of the two vectors $\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{v}$ and $\\mathbf{A}^T \\mathbf{v}$.\n",

        "The main computational challenge in Kriging is solving for the weights needed for prediction, which requires **inverting the covariance matrix K**. For `n` data points, **K** is an `n x n` matrix, and inverting it has computational complexity $O(n^3)$. This becomes impractical for large datasets.\n",
        "\n",
        "**The Nyström Solution:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Since the covariance matrix in Kriging is a type of kernel matrix, we can use the Nyström method to create a low-rank approximation, $\\tilde{K}$. Instead of inverting the full matrix, we use the **Woodbury matrix identity** on the Nyström approximation, allowing us to efficiently compute $\\tilde{K}^{-1}$ without forming the full matrix. This reduces computational complexity to roughly $O(l^2 n)$, where `l` is the number of sampled columns.\n",

        "\n",
        "The Sequential Parameter Optimization Toolbox (spotpython) is a framework for hyperparameter tuning and black-box optimization based on Sequential Model-Based Optimization (SMBO). At the core of SMBO lies a surrogate model that approximates the true, expensive objective. Kriging (Gaussian Process regression) is a premier choice because it provides both predictions and a principled measure of uncertainty. This uncertainty enables a balance between exploration and exploitation. In each SMBO iteration, the Kriging model is updated with new evaluations, refining its approximation and proposing the next points.\n",
        "\n",
        "Standard Kriging requires constructing and inverting an $n \\times n$ covariance matrix, where $n$ is the number of data points. Matrix inversion scales as $O(n^3)$. During SMBO, $n$ can reach hundreds or thousands; refitting the surrogate each iteration becomes prohibitively expensive. This cubic scaling is the key obstacle to applying Kriging at larger scales.\n",
        "\n",
        "We integrate the Nyström method into the spotpython Kriging class. The Nyström method yields a low-rank approximation of a symmetric positive semidefinite (SPSD) kernel matrix by selecting $l \\ll n$ “landmark” points. It approximates the full $n \\times n$ covariance while requiring inversion of only an $l \\times l$ matrix, reducing fitting cost from $O(n^3)$ to $O(n\\,l^2)$. This makes Kriging viable even when the number of function evaluations is large.\n",
