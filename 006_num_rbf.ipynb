These fundamental building blocks possess properties that make them easier to analyze mathematically and implement computationally. We explored this concept earlier with multivariable polynomials, where complex behaviors were modeled using combinations of polynomial terms such as $1$, $x_1$, $x_2$, $x_1^2$, and $x_1 x_2$. This approach is not limited to polynomials; it extends to various function classes, including trigonometric functions, exponential functions, and even more complex structures.\n",

The class stores the sampling plan $X$ as the X attribute and the corresponding $n$-vector of responses $y$ as the y attribute. The code attribute specifies the type of basis function to be used. After fitting the model, the class will also contain the estimated parameter values $\\vec{w}$ and, if a parametric basis function is used, $\\sigma$. These are stored in the weights and sigma attributes respectively.\n",

They also possess another desirable feature: it is relatively easy to estimate their prediction error at any $\\vec{x}$ in the design space. Additionally, the expectation function of the improvement in minimum (or maximum) function value with respect to the minimum (or maximum) known so far can also be calculated quite easily, both of these features being very useful when the optimization of $f$ is the goal of the surrogate modelling process.\n",

        "The RBF network approach, on the other hand, places basis functions at strategic points (e.g., 5 evenly spaced centers). Each neuron computes $\\psi(||x - c_i||)$ (e.g., using Gaussian RBF). The output layer combines these values with learned weights. If we place Gaussian RBFs with $\\sigma=0.15$ at ${0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9}$, each neuron responds strongly when the input is close to its center and weakly otherwise. The network can then learn weights that, when multiplied by these response patterns and summed, closely approximate the sine function.\n",

        "When the responses $\\vec{y} = {y^{(1)}, y^{(2)}, \\ldots, y^{(n)}}^T$ contain measurement or simulation noise, the standard RBF interpolation approach can lead to overfitting—the model captures both the underlying function and the random noise. This compromises generalization performance on new data points. Two principal strategies address this challenge:\n",

        "The most straightforward solution involves introducing regularization through the parameter $\\lambda$ [@pogg90a].
