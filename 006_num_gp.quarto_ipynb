        "Mathematical models implemented in computer codes are used to circumvent the need for expensive field data collection. These models are particularly useful when dealing with highly nonlinear response surfaces, high signal-to-noise ratios (which often involve deterministic evaluations), and a global scope. As a result, a new approach is required in comparison to Response Surface Methodology (RSM).\n",
        "\n",
        "With the improvement in computing power and simulation fidelity, researchers gain higher confidence and a better understanding of the dynamics in physical, biological, and social systems. However, the expansion of configuration spaces and increasing input dimensions necessitates more extensive designs. High-performance computing (HPC) allows for thousands of runs, whereas previously only tens were possible. This shift towards larger models and training data presents new computational challenges.\n",
        "\n",
        "Research questions for DACE (Design and Analysis of Computer Experiments) include how to design computer experiments that make efficient use of computation and how to meta-model computer codes to save on simulation effort. The choice of surrogate model for computer codes significantly impacts the optimal experiment design, and the preferred model-design pairs can vary depending on the specific goal.\n",
        "\n",
        "The combination of computer simulation, design, and modeling with field data from similar real-world experiments introduces a new category of computer model tuning problems. The ultimate goal is to automate these processes to the greatest extent possible, allowing for the deployment of HPC with minimal human intervention.\n",
        "\n",
        "One of the remaining differences between RSM and DACE lies in how they handle noise. DACE employs replication, a technique that would not be used in a deterministic setting, to separate signal from noise. Traditional RSM is best suited for situations where a substantial proportion of the variability in the data is due to noise, and where the acquisition of data values can be severely limited. Consequently, RSM is better suited for a different class of problems, aligning with its intended purposes.\n",

Additionally, it is referred to as Gaussian spatial modeling or a Gaussian stochastic process, and machine learning (ML) researchers often use the term Gaussian process regression (GPR).\n",
