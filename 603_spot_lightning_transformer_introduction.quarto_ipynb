        "\n",
        "In this chapter, we will introduce transformer. The transformer architecture is a neural network architecture that is based on the attention mechanism [@vasw17a]. It is particularly well suited for sequence-to-sequence tasks, such as machine translation, text summarization, and more. The transformer architecture has been a breakthrough in the field of natural language processing (NLP) and has been the basis for many state-of-the-art models in the field. \n",
        "\n",
        "We start with a description of the transformer basics in @sec-transformer-basics. \n",
        "@sec-details-implementation provides a detailed description of the implementation of the transformer architecture.\n",
        "Finally, an example of a transformer implemented in PyTorch Lightning in presented in @sec-transformer-in-lightning.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Transformer Basics {#sec-transformer-basics}\n",
        "\n",
        "### Embedding\n",
        "\n",
        "Word embedding is a technique where words or phrases (so-called tokens) from the vocabulary are mapped to vectors of real numbers.\n",
        "These vectors capture the semantic properties of the words. Words that are similar in meaning are mapped to vectors that are close to each other in the vector space, and words that are dissimilar are mapped to vectors that are far apart.\n",
        "Word embeddings are needed for transformers for several reasons:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Dimensionality Reduction: Word embeddings reduce the dimensionality of the data. Instead of dealing with high-dimensional sparse vectors (like one-hot encoded vectors), we deal with dense vectors of much lower dimensionality.\n",
        "* Capturing Semantic Similarities: Word embeddings capture semantic similarities between words. This is crucial for tasks like text classification, sentiment analysis, etc., where the meaning of the words is important.\n",
        "* Handling Unknown Words: If a word is not present in the training data but appears in the test data, one-hot encoding cannot handle it. But word embeddings can handle such situations by mapping the unknown word to a vector that is similar to known words.\n",
        "* Input to Neural Networks: Transformers, like other neural networks, work with numerical data. Word embeddings provide a way to convert text data into numerical form that can be fed into these networks.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the context of transformers, word embeddings are used as the initial input representation. The transformer then learns more complex representations by considering the context in which each token appears.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Neural Network for Embeddings\n",
        "\n",
        "Idea for word embeddings: use a relatively simple NN that has one input for every token (word, symbol) in the vocabulary. The output of the NN is a vector of a fixed size, which is the word embedding. The network that is used in this chapter is visualized in @fig-transformer-attention. For simplicity, a 2-dimensional output vector is used in this visualization. The weights of the NN are randomly initialized, and are learned during training.\n",
        "\n",
        "![Transformer. Computation of the self attention. In this example, we consider two inputs, i.e.,  (1,0) and (0,1). For each input, there are two values, which results in a $2 \\times 2$ matrix. In general, when there are $T$ inputs, a $T \\times T$ matrix will be generated.

        "\n",
        "All tokens are embedded in this way. For each token there are two numerical values, the embedding vector.\n",
        "The same network is used for embedding all tokens.\n",
        "If a longer input is added, it can be embedded with the same net.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Positional Encoding for the Embeddings\n",
        "\n",
        "Positional encoding is added to the input embeddings to give the model some information about the relative or absolute position of the tokens in the sequence. The positional encodings have the same dimension as the embeddings so that the two can be summed.\n",
        "\n",
        "If a token occurs several times, it is embedded several times and receives different embedding vectors, as the position is taken into account by the positional encoding.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Attention\n",
        "\n",
        "Attention describes how similar is each token to itself and to all other tokens in the input, e.g., in a sentence.\n",
        "The attention mechanism can be implemented as a set of layers in neural networks. There are a lot of different possible definitions of \"attention\" in the literature, but the one we will use here is the following: _the attention mechanism describes a weighted average of (sequence) elements with the weights dynamically computed based on an input query and elements' keys_ [@lipp22a].\n",
        "\n",
        "The goal is to take an average over the features of multiple elements. \n",
        "However, instead of weighting each element equally, we want to weight them depending on their actual values.\n",
        "In other words, we want to dynamically decide on which inputs we want to \"attend\" more than others.\n",
        "\n",
        "Calculation of the self-attention:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Queries: Calculate two new values from the (two) values of the embedding vector using an NN, which are referred to as query values.\n",
        "2. Keys: Calculate two new values, called key values, from the (two) values of the embedding vector using an NN.\n",
        "3. Dot product: Calculate the dot product of the query values and the key values. This is a measure of the similarity of the query and key values.\n",
        "4. Softmax: Apply the softmax function to the outputs from the dot product. This is a measure of the attention that a token pays to other tokens.\n",
        "5. Values: Calculate two new values from the (two) values of the embedding vector using an NN, which are referred to as value values.\n",
        "6. The values are multiplied (weighted) by the values of the softmax function.\n",
        "7. The weighted values are summed. Now we have the self attention value for the token.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### Self-Attention {#sec-self-attention}\n",
        "\n",
        "Most attention mechanisms differ in terms of what queries they use, how the key and value vectors are defined, and what score function is used. The attention applied inside the Transformer architecture is called \"self-attention\". In self-attention, each sequence element provides a key, value, and query. For each element, we perform an attention layer where based on its query, we check the similarity of the all sequence elements' keys, and returned a different, averaged value vector for each element. \n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### Masked Self-Attention\n",
        "\n",
        "Masked self-attention is a variant of the self-attention method described in @sec-self-attention. It asks the question:\n",
        "How similar is each token to itself and to all preceding tokens in the input (sentence)?\n",
        "Masked self-attention is an autoregressive mechanism, which means that the attention mechanism is only allowed to look at the tokens that have already been processed.\n",
        "Calculation of the mask self-attention is identical to the self-attention, but the attention is only calculated for the tokens that have already been processed.\n",
        "If the masked self-attention method is applied to the first token, the masked self-attention value is exactly the value of the first token, as it only takes itself into account.\n",
        "For the other tokens, the masked self-attention value is a weighted sum of the values of the previous tokens. The weighting is determined by the similarity of the query values and the key values (dot product and softmax).\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### Generation of Outputs\n",
        "\n",
        "To calculate the output, we use a residual connector that adds the output of the neural network and the output of the masked self-attention method. We thus obtain the residual connection values. The residual connector is used to facilitate training.\n",
        "\n",
        "To generate the next token, we use another neural network that calculates the output from the (two) residual connection values.\n",
        "The input layer of the neural network has the size of the residual connection values, the output layer has the number of tokens in the vocabulary as a dimension.\n",
        "\n",
        "If we now enter the residual connection value of the first token, we receive the token (or the probabilities using Softmax) that is to come next as the output of the neural network. \n",
        "This makes sense even if we already know the second token (as with the first token): We can use it to calculate the error of the neural network and train the network.\n",
        "In addition, the decoder-transformer uses the masked self-attention method to calculate the output, i.e. the encoding and generation of new tokens is done with exactly the same elements of the network.\n",
        "\n",
        "Note: ChatGPT does not use a new neural network, but the same network that was already used to calculate the embedding. The network is therefore used for embedding, masked self-attention and calculating the output. In the last calculation, the network is inverted, i.e. it is run in the opposite direction to obtain the tokens and not the embeddings as in the original run.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### End-Of-Sequence-Token\n",
        "\n",
        "The end-of-sequence token is used to signal the end of the input and also to start generating new tokens after the input.\n",
        "The EOS token recognizes all other tokens, as it comes after all tokens.\n",
        "When generating tokens, it is important to consider the relationships between the input tokens and the generation of new tokens. \n",

        "* *Score function*: To rate which elements we want to pay attention to, we need to specify a score function $f_{attn}$. The score function takes the query and a key as input, and output the score/attention weight of the query-key pair.

For simplicity, we neglect the batch dimension for now. The attention value from element $i$ to $j$ is based on its similarity of the query $Q_i$ and key $K_j$, using the dot product as the similarity metric (in @fig-transformer-attention, we considered $Q_2$ and $K_1$ as well as $Q_2$ and $K_2$). \n",

However, often there are multiple different aspects a sequence element wants to attend to, and a single weighted average is not a good option for it. This is why we extend the attention mechanisms to multiple heads, i.e. multiple different query-key-value triplets on the same features. Specifically, given a query, key, and value matrix, we transform those into $h$ sub-queries, sub-keys, and sub-values, which we pass through the scaled dot product attention independently. Afterward, we concatenate the heads and combine them with a final weight matrix. Mathematically, we can express this operation as:\n",

        "One crucial characteristic of the multi-head attention is that it is permutation-equivariant with respect to its inputs. This means that if we switch two input elements in the sequence, e.g. $X_1\\leftrightarrow X_2$ (neglecting the batch dimension for now), the output is exactly the same besides the elements 1 and 2 switched. Hence, the multi-head attention is actually looking at the input not as a sequence, but as a set of elements. This property makes the multi-head attention block and the Transformer architecture so powerful and widely applicable! But what if the order of the input is actually important for solving the task, like language modeling? The answer is to encode the position in the input features, which we will take a closer look in @sec-positional-encoding.\n",

        "\n",
        "Next, we will look at how to apply the multi-head attention block inside the Transformer architecture. Originally, the Transformer model was designed for machine translation. Hence, it got an encoder-decoder structure where the encoder takes as input the sentence in the original language and generates an attention-based representation. On the other hand, the decoder attends over the encoded information and generates the translated sentence in an autoregressive manner, as in a standard RNN. While this structure is extremely useful for Sequence-to-Sequence tasks with the necessity of autoregressive decoding, we will focus here on the encoder part. Many advances in NLP have been made using pure encoder-based Transformer models (if interested, models include the BERT-family [@devl18a], the Vision Transformer [@deso20a], and more). We will also mainly focus on the encoder part. If you have understood the encoder architecture, the decoder is a very small step to implement as well. The full Transformer architecture looks as shown in @fig-transformer-architecture.\n",

        "2. Without the residual connection, the information about the original sequence is lost. Remember that the Multi-Head Attention layer ignores the position of elements in a sequence, and can only learn it based on the input features. Removing the residual connections would mean that this information is lost after the first attention layer (after initialization), and with a randomly initialized query and key vector, the output vectors for position $i$ has no relation to its original input. All outputs of the attention are likely to represent similar/same information, and there is no chance for the model to distinguish which information came from which input element. An alternative option to residual connection would be to fix at least one head to focus on its original input, but this is very inefficient and does not have the benefit of the improved gradient flow.\n",

        "\n",
        "We have discussed before that the Multi-Head Attention block is permutation-equivariant, and cannot distinguish whether an input comes before another one in the sequence or not. In tasks like language understanding, however, the position is important for interpreting the input words. The position information can therefore be added via the input features. We could learn a embedding for every possible position, but this would not generalize to a dynamical input sequence length. Hence, the better option is to use feature patterns that the network can identify from the features and potentially generalize to larger sequences. The specific pattern chosen by @vasw17a are sine and cosine functions of different frequencies, as follows:\n",

These values, concatenated for all hidden dimensions, are added to the original input features (in the Transformer visualization above, see \"Positional encoding\"), and constitute the position information. We distinguish between even ($i \\text{ mod } 2=0$) and uneven ($i \\text{ mod } 2=1$) hidden dimensionalities where we apply a sine/cosine respectively. The intuition behind this encoding is that you can represent $PE_{(pos+k,:)}$ as a linear function of $PE_{(pos,:)}$, which might allow the model to easily attend to relative positions. The wavelengths in different dimensions range from $2\\pi$ to $10000\\cdot 2\\pi$.\n",

        "\n",
        "One commonly used technique for training a Transformer is learning rate warm-up. This means that we gradually increase the learning rate from 0 on to our originally specified learning rate in the first few iterations. Thus, we slowly start learning instead of taking very large steps from the beginning. In fact, training a deep Transformer without learning rate warm-up can make the model diverge and achieve a much worse performance on training and testing. Take for instance the following plot by [Liu et al. (2019)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.03265.pdf) comparing Adam-vanilla (i.e. Adam without warm-up) vs Adam with a warm-up:\n",
        "\n",
        "![Warm-up comparison. Figure taken from @liu19a](./figures_static/warmup_loss_plot.png)\n",
        "\n",
        "Clearly, the warm-up is a crucial hyperparameter in the Transformer architecture. Why is it so important? There are currently two common explanations. Firstly, Adam uses the bias correction factors which however can lead to a higher variance in the adaptive learning rate during the first iterations. Improved optimizers like [RAdam](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.03265) have been shown to overcome this issue, not requiring warm-up for training Transformers. Secondly, the iteratively applied Layer Normalization across layers can lead to very high gradients during the first iterations, which can be solved by using [Pre-Layer Normalization](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/328-Paper.pdf) (similar to Pre-Activation ResNet), or replacing Layer Normalization by other techniques ([Adaptive Normalization](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/328-Paper.pdf), [Power Normalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.07845)). \n",
        "\n",
        "Nevertheless, many applications and papers still use the original Transformer architecture with Adam, because warm-up is a simple, yet effective way of solving the gradient problem in the first iterations. There are many different schedulers we could use. For instance, the original Transformer paper used an exponential decay scheduler with a warm-up. However, the currently most popular scheduler is the cosine warm-up scheduler, which combines warm-up with a cosine-shaped learning rate decay. We can implement it below, and visualize the learning rate factor over epochs. \n"

        "A Sequence-to-Sequence task represents a task where the input _and_ the output is a sequence, not necessarily of the same length. Popular tasks in this domain include machine translation and summarization. For this, we usually have a Transformer encoder for interpreting the input sequence, and a decoder for generating the output in an autoregressive manner. Here, however, we will go back to a much simpler example task and use only the encoder. Given a sequence of $N$ numbers between $0$ and $M$, the task is to reverse the input sequence. In Numpy notation, if our input is $x$, the output should be $x$[::-1]. Although this task sounds very simple, RNNs can have issues with such because the task requires long-term dependencies. Transformers are built to support such, and hence, we expect it to perform very well. \n",

        "The model has learned to attend to the token that is on the flipped index of itself. Hence, it actually does what we intended it to do. We see that it however also pays some attention to values close to the flipped index. This is because the model doesn't need the perfect, hard attention to solve this problem, but is fine with this approximate, noisy attention map. The close-by indices are caused by the similarity of the positional encoding, which we also intended with the positional encoding.\n",

        "In this chapter, we took a closer look at the Multi-Head Attention layer which uses a scaled dot product between queries and keys to find correlations and similarities between input elements. The Transformer architecture is based on the Multi-Head Attention layer and applies multiple of them in a ResNet-like block. The Transformer is a very important, recent architecture that can be applied to many tasks and datasets. Although it is best known for its success in NLP, there is so much more to it. We have seen its application on sequence-to-sequence tasks. Its property of being permutation-equivariant if we do not provide any positional encodings, allows it to generalize to many settings. Hence, it is important to know the architecture, but also its possible issues such as the gradient problem during the first iterations solved by learning rate warm-up. If you are interested in continuing with the study of the Transformer architecture, please have a look at the blog posts listed in the \"Further Reading\" section below.\n",

        "We can compare the self-attention operation with our other common layer competitors for sequence data: convolutions and recurrent neural networks. In @fig-comparison-conv-rnn you can find a table by @vasw17a on the complexity per layer, the number of sequential operations, and maximum path length. The complexity is measured by the upper bound of the number of operations to perform, while the maximum path length represents the maximum number of steps a forward or backward signal has to traverse to reach any other position. The lower this length, the better gradient signals can backpropagate for long-range dependencies. Let's take a look at the table in @fig-comparison-conv-rnn.\n",

        "$n$ is the sequence length, $d$ is the representation dimension and $k$ is the kernel size of convolutions. In contrast to recurrent networks, the self-attention layer can parallelize all its operations making it much faster to execute for smaller sequence lengths. However, when the sequence length exceeds the hidden dimensionality, self-attention becomes more expensive than RNNs. One way of reducing the computational cost for long sequences is by restricting the self-attention to a neighborhood of inputs to attend over, denoted by $r$. Nevertheless, there has been recently a lot of work on more efficient Transformer architectures that still allow long dependencies, of which you can find an overview in the paper by @tay20a if interested.\n",
