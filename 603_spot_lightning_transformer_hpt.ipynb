        "   - All input features are projected into this dimensional space before entering the transformer encoder.\n",
        "   - This dimension must be divisible by `nhead` since each head in the multi-head attention mechanism will process a subset of `d_model/nhead` features.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. `nhead`:\n",
        "\n",
        "   - This is the number of attention heads in the multi-head attention mechanism.\n",
        "   - It allows the transformer to jointly attend to information from different representation subspaces.\n",
        "   - It's important that `d_model % nhead == 0` to ensure the dimensions are evenly split among the heads.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. `num_encoder_layers`:\n",
        "\n",
        "   - This specifies the number of transformer encoder layers stacked together.\n",
        "   - Each layer contains a multi-head attention mechanism followed by position-wise feedforward layers.\n",

        "4. `dim_feedforward`:\n",
        "\n",
        "   - This is the dimension of the feedforward network model within the transformer encoder layer.\n",
        "   - Typically, this dimension is larger than `d_model` (e.g., 2048 for a Transformer model with `d_model=512`).\n",

        "\n",

        "  - As mentioned, `d_model` must be divisible by `nhead`. This is critical because each attention head operates simultaneously on a part of the embedding, so `d_model/nhead` should be an integer.\n",
        "\n",
        "- `num_encoder_layers` and `dim_feedforward`**: \n",
        "  - These parameters are more flexible and can be chosen independently of `d_model` and `nhead`.\n",

        "\n",
        "1. Setting `d_model`:\n",

        "\n",
        "2. Setting `nhead`:\n",
        "\n",
        "   - Typically, values are 1, 2, 4, 8, etc., depending on the `d_model` value.\n",
        "   - Each head works on a subset of features, so `d_model / nhead` should be large enough to be meaningful.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Setting `num_encoder_layers`:\n",
        "\n",
        "   - Practical values range from 1 to 12 or more depending on the depth desired.\n",
        "   - Deeper models can capture more complex patterns but are also more computationally intensive.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Setting `dim_feedforward`:\n",
        "\n",
        "   - Often set to a multiple of `d_model`, such as 2048 when `d_model` is 512.\n",
