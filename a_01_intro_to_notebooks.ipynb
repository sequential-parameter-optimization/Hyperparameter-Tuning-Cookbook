        "Jupyter Notebook is a widely used tool in the Data Science community. It is easy to use and the produced code can be run per cell. This has a huge advantage, because with other tools e.g. (pycharm, vscode, etc.) the whole script is executed. This can be a time consuming process, especially when working with huge data sets. \n",
