For the algorithms presented in Chap. 2, it is clarified to what extent concept drift is reacted to. In turn, the extent to which catastrophic forgetting is an issue is described in Sect. 4.3. Section 3.1 describes three architectures for implementing drift detection algorithms. Basic properties of window-based approaches are presented in Sect. 3.2. Section 3.4 presents commonly used drift detection techniques. Section 3.4 describes how the drift detection techniques introduced in Sect. 3.3 are used in Online Machine Learning (OML) algorithms and summarizes the tree-based OML techniques implemented in the River package. Section 3.5 introduces scaling methods for handling drift.},

We demonstrate that an implementation of Hoeffding Anytime Tree'“Extremely Fast Decision Tree”, a minor modification to the MOA implementation of Hoeffding Tree'obtains significantly superior prequential accuracy on most of the largest classification datasets from the UCI repository. Hoeffding Anytime Tree produces the asymptotic batch tree in the limit, is naturally resilient to concept drift, and can be used as a higher accuracy replacement for Hoeffding Tree in most scenarios, at a small additional computational cost.},
