For the algorithms presented in Chap. 2, it is clarified to what extent concept drift is reacted to. In turn, the extent to which catastrophic forgetting is an issue is described in Sect. 4.3. Section 3.1 describes three architectures for implementing drift detection algorithms. Basic properties of window-based approaches are presented in Sect. 3.2. Section 3.4 presents commonly used drift detection techniques. Section 3.4 describes how the drift detection techniques introduced in Sect. 3.3 are used in Online Machine Learning (OML) algorithms and summarizes the tree-based OML techniques implemented in the River package. Section 3.5 introduces scaling methods for handling drift.},

We demonstrate that an implementation of Hoeffding Anytime Tree'“Extremely Fast Decision Tree”, a minor modification to the MOA implementation of Hoeffding Tree'obtains significantly superior prequential accuracy on most of the largest classification datasets from the UCI repository. Hoeffding Anytime Tree produces the asymptotic batch tree in the limit, is naturally resilient to concept drift, and can be used as a higher accuracy replacement for Hoeffding Tree in most scenarios, at a small additional computational cost.},

@article{pogg90a,
	abstract = {Learning an input-output mapping from a set of examples, of the type that many neural networks have been constructed to perform, can be regarded as synthesizing an approximation of a multidimensional function (that is, solving the problem of hypersurface reconstruction). From this point of view, this form of learning is closely related to classical approximation techniques, such as generalized splines and regularization theory. A theory is reported that shows the equivalence between regularization and a class of three-layer networks called regularization networks or hyper basis functions. These networks are not only equivalent to generalized splines but are also closely related to the classical radial basis functions used for interpolation tasks and to several pattern recognition and neural network algorithms. They also have an interesting interpretation in terms of prototypes that are synthesized and optimally combined during the learning stage.},

	abstract = {Recent work by Johnson et al. (J. Statist. Plann. Inference 26 (1990) 131--148) establishes equivalence of the maximin distance design criterion and an entropy criterion motivated by function prediction in a Bayesian setting. The latter criterion has been used by Currin et al. (J. Amer. Statist. Assoc. 86 (1991) 953--963) to design experiments for which the motivating application is approximation of a complex deterministic computer model. Because computer experiments often have a large number of controlled variables (inputs), maximin designs of moderate size are often concentrated in the corners of the cuboidal design region, i.e. each input is represented at only two levels. Here we will examine some maximin distance designs constructed within the class of Latin hypercube arrangements. The goal of this is to find designs which offer a compromise between the entropy/maximin criterion, and good projective properties in each dimension (as guaranteed by Latin hypercubes). A simulated annealing search algorithm is presented for constructing these designs, and patterns apparent in the optimal designs are discussed.},
