        "\n",
        "The goal of a sampling plan is to efficiently explore the input space to understand the behavior of the computer code and build a surrogate model that accurately represents the code's behavior.\n",
        "Traditionally, Response Surface Methodology (RSM) has been used to design sampling plans for computer experiments.\n",
        "These sampling plans are based on procedures that generate points by means of a rectangular grid or a factorial design.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, more recently, Design and Analysis of Computer Experiments (DACE) has emerged as a more flexible and powerful approach for designing sampling plans.\n",
        "\n",
        "Engineering design often requires the construction of a surrogate model $\\hat{f}$ to approximate the expensive response of a black-box function $f$. The function $f(x)$ represents a continuous metric (e.g., quality, cost, or performance) defined over a design space $D \\subset \\mathbb{R}^k$, where $x$ is a $k$-dimensional vector of design variables. Since evaluating $f$ is costly, only a sparse set of samples is used to construct $\\hat{f}$, which can then provide inexpensive predictions for any $x \\in D$.\n",

        "In high-dimensional spaces, the amount of data needed to maintain the same level of accuracy or coverage increases dramatically. For example, if a one-dimensional space requires $n$ samples for a certain accuracy, a $k$-dimensional space would require $n^k$ samples. This makes tasks like optimization, sampling, and modeling computationally expensive and often impractical in high-dimensional settings.\n",

        "Now, if we add 8 more variables (e.g., tread pattern, rubber type, etc.), the number of simulations required increases to $10^8$ (10 million). This is because the number of combinations of design variables grows exponentially with the number of dimensions.\n",

In practice, the sample mean and standard deviation of a set of $d_i(x)$ values, calculated in different parts of the design space, are used for this estimation.\n",

Additionally, the sampling plan should provide a specified number (e.g., $r$) of elementary effects for each variable, independently drawn with replacement. For a detailed discussion on constructing such a sampling plan, readers are encouraged to consult Morris's original paper (Morris, 1991). Here, we focus on describing the process itself.\n",

This task is non-trivial; as the reader may recall from the earlier discussion on Latin squares, this search space is vast. In fact, its vastness means that for many practical applications, locating the globally optimal solution is often infeasible. Therefore, the objective becomes finding the best possible sampling plan achievable within a specific computational time budget.\n",

Determining the optimal allocation of total computational effort—between generating the sampling plan and actually evaluating the objective function at the selected points—remains an open research question. However, it is typical for no more than approximately 5% of the total available time to be allocated to the task of generating the sampling plan itself.\n",

Consequently, the smallest modification that can be applied to a Latin hypercube—without compromising its crucial multidimensional stratification property—involves swapping two elements within any single column of $X$.
