    "1. Binary Classification\n",

    "\n",
    "Depending on the task, the user can select the data set, the preprocessing model, the core model, and the evaluation function.\n",
    "\n",

    "`spotPython.utils.tensorboard` provides the methods `start_tensorboard` and `stop_tensorboard` to start and stop tensorboard as a background process.\n",

    "\n",
    "`run_spot_river_experiment` calls the tuner spot after processing the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Generate an experiment name.\n",
    "2. Initialize the `fun_control` dictionary.\n",
    "3. Select the data set based on the `data_set` parameter and generate a data frame.\n",
    "4. Splits the data into training and test sets.\n",
    "5. Sets the oml_grace_period parameter.\n",
    "6. Select the preprocessing model based on the `prepmodel` parameter.\n",
    "7. Sets the weights for the evaluation function and the weight coeffient.\n",
    "8. Loads the coremodel based on the `coremodel` parameter with hyperparameters set to the values specified in the `RiverHyperDict` dictionary.\n",
    "9. Determines the default hyperparameters.\n",
    "10. Selects the evaluation function: `HyperRiver.fun_oml_horizon`.\n",
    "11. Determines hyperparameter types, names, lower and upper bounds for the `spot` tuner.\n",
    "12. Starts tensorboard as a background process.\n",
    "13. Starts the `spot` tuner.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the tuner is finished, the following steps are performed:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The tensorboard process is terminated.\n",
    "2. The spot_tuner object and the `fun_control` dictionary are returned.\n",

    "The `run_spot_river_experiment` method is located in `spotRiver.tuner.run.py` and is called by the GUI. It calls the `fun_oml_horizon` evaluation function and the spot tuner.\n",

    "### The fun_oml_horizon Method\n",
    "\n",
    "The `fun_oml_horizon` method is located in `spotRiver.hyperriver.py` file. It calls the `evaluate_model` method, which in turn calls the `eval_oml_horizon` method from the `spotRiver.evaluation.eval_bml.py` file.\n",
