    "\n",
    "Depending on the task, the user can select the data set, the preprocessing model, the metric, and the online machine learning model.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Binary Classification\n",

    "### River Data Sets {#sec-river-datasets}\n",
    "\n",
    "The following data sets from the `river` package are available:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `Bananas`: An artificial dataset where instances belongs to several clusters with a banana shape.There are two attributes that correspond to the x and y axis, respectively. More: [https://riverml.xyz/dev/api/datasets/Bananas/](https://riverml.xyz/dev/api/datasets/Bananas/).\n",
    "* `CreditCard`: Credit card frauds. The datasets contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders. This dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. The dataset is highly unbalanced, the positive class (frauds) account for 0.172% of all transactions. It contains only numerical input variables which are the result of a PCA transformation. Unfortunately, due to confidentiality issues, we cannot provide the original features and more background information about the data. Features `V1`, `V2`,...,`V28` are the principal components obtained with PCA, the only features which have not been transformed with PCA are '`Time`' and '`Amount`'. Feature '`Time`' contains the seconds elapsed between each transaction and the first transaction in the dataset. The feature '`Amount`' is the transaction Amount, this feature can be used for example-dependant cost-sensitive learning. Feature '`Class`' is the response variable and it takes value 1 in case of fraud and 0 otherwise. More: [https://riverml.xyz/dev/api/datasets/CreditCard/](https://riverml.xyz/dev/api/datasets/CreditCard/).\n",
    "* `Elec2`: Electricity prices in New South Wales. This is a binary classification task, where the goal is to predict if the price of electricity will go up or down. This data was collected from the Australian New South Wales Electricity Market. In this market, prices are not fixed and are affected by demand and supply of the market. They are set every five minutes. Electricity transfers to/from the neighboring state of Victoria were done to alleviate fluctuations. More: [https://riverml.xyz/dev/api/datasets/Elec2/](https://riverml.xyz/dev/api/datasets/Elec2/).\n",
    "* `Higgs`: The data has been produced using Monte Carlo simulations. The first 21 features (columns 2-22) are kinematic properties measured by the particle detectors in the accelerator. The last seven features are functions of the first 21 features; these are high-level features derived by physicists to help discriminate between the two classes. More: [https://riverml.xyz/dev/api/datasets/Higgs/](https://riverml.xyz/dev/api/datasets/Higgs/).\n",
    "* `HTTP`: HTTP dataset of the KDD 1999 cup. The goal is to predict whether or not an HTTP connection is anomalous or not. The dataset only contains 2,211 (0.4%) positive labels. More: [https://riverml.xyz/dev/api/datasets/HTTP/](https://riverml.xyz/dev/api/datasets/HTTP/).\n",
    "* `Phishing`: Phishing websites. This dataset contains features from web pages that are classified as phishing or not.[https://riverml.xyz/dev/api/datasets/Phishing/](https://riverml.xyz/dev/api/datasets/Phishing/)\n",
    "\n",
    "### User Data Sets\n",
    "\n",
    "Besides the `river` data sets described in @sec-river-datasets, the user can also select a user-defined data set. Currently, comma-separated values (CSV) files are supported. Further formats will be supported soon. The user-defined CSV data set must be a binary classification task with the target variable in the last column. The first row must contain the column names. If the file is copied to the subdirectory `userData`, the user can select the data set from the `Data` drop-down menu.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, we have provided a CSV-version of the `Phishing` data set. The file is located in the `userData` subdirectory and is called `PhishingData.csv`. It contains the following columns:\n",

    "Based on the required format, we can see that `target_column` is the last column, here: `is_phishing`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stream Data Sets\n",
    "\n",
    "Forthcoming versions of the GUI will support stream data sets, e.g, the Friedman data set as described in @bart23c5. The Friedman-Drift data was also used in the hyperparameter tuning study in @bart23c10.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Set Options\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, the user can select the following parameters for the data sets:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `target_column`: The target column.\n",
    "* `n_total`: The total number of instances. Since some data sets are quite large, the user can select a subset of the data set by specifying the `n_total` value.\n",
    "* `test_size`: The size of the test set in percent (0.0-1.0). The training set will be `1 - test_size`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To compare different data scaling methods, the user can select the preprocessing model from the `Preprocessing` drop-down menu.\n",
    "Currently, the following preprocessing models are available:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `StandardScaler`: Standardize features by removing the mean and scaling to unit variance.\n",
    "* `MinMaxScaler`: Scale features to a range.\n",
    "* `None`: No scaling is performed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `spotRiverGUI` will not provide sophisticated data preprocessing methods. We assume that the data was preprocessed before it is copied into the `userData` subdirectory.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Regression tasks will be supported soon.\n",
    "The same workflow as for the binary classification task will be used, i.e., the user can select the data set, the preprocessing model, the metric, and the online machine learning model.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Experiment Options\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, the user can select the following options for specifying the experiment duration:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `MAX_TIME`: The maximum time in minutes for the experiment.\n",
    "* `FUN_EVALS`: The number of function evaluations for the experiment. \n",
    "\n",
    "If the `MAX_TIME` is reached or `FUN_EVALS` OML-models are evaluated, the experiment will be stopped.\n",
    "\n",
    "::: {.callout-note}\n",
    "#### Initial design is always evaluated\n",
    "\n",
    "* The initial design will always be evaluated before one of the stopping criteria is reached.\n",
    "* If the initial design is very large or the model evaluations are very time-consuming, the runtime will be larger than the `MAX_TIME` value.\n",
    "\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the `INIT_SIZE`, the number of hyperparameter configurations for the initial design can be specified. The initial design is evaluated before the first surrogate model is build. A detailed description of the initial design and the surrogate model based hyperparameter tuning can be found in @bart23c5 and in @bart21ic3.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `PREFIX` parameter can be used to specify  the experiment name.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `spotPython` hyperparameter tuning program allows the user to specify several options for the hyperparameter tuning process. The `spotRiverGUI` will support more options in future versions. Currently, the user can specify whether the outcome from the experiment is noisy or deterministic. The corresponding parameter is called `NOISE`. The reader is referred to @bart23c10 and to the chapter \"Handling Noise\" ([https://sequential-parameter-optimization.github.io/Hyperparameter-Tuning-Cookbook/013_num_spot_noisy.html](https://sequential-parameter-optimization.github.io/Hyperparameter-Tuning-Cookbook/013_num_spot_noisy.html)) for further information about the `NOISE` parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Evaluation Options\n",
    "\n",
    "The user can select one of the following evaluation metrics for binary classification tasks from the `metric` drop-down menu:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `accuracy_score`\n",
    "* `cohen_kappa_score`\n",
    "* `f1_score`\n",
    "* `hamming_loss`\n",
    "* `hinge_loss`\n",
    "* `jaccard_score`\n",
    "* `matthews_corrcoef`\n",
    "* `precision_score`\n",
    "* `recall_score`\n",
    "* `roc_auc_score`\n",
    "* `zero_one_loss`\n",
    "\n",
    "These metrics are based on the `scikit-learn` module, which  implements several loss, score, and utility functions to measure classification performance, see [https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/model_evaluation.html#classification-metrics](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/model_evaluation.html#classification-metrics). `spotRiverGUI` supports metrics that are computed from the `y_pred` and the `y_true` values. The `y_pred` values are the predicted target values, and the `y_true` values are the true target values. The `y_pred` values are generated by the online machine learning model, and the `y_true` values are the true target values from the data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "::: {.callout-note}\n",
    "#### Evaluation Metrics: Minimization and Maximization\n",
    "\n",
    "* Some metrics are minimized, and some are maximized. The `spotRiverGUI` will support the user in selecting the correct metric based on the task. For example, the `accuracy_score` is maximized, and the `hamming_loss` is minimized. The user can select the metric and `spotRiverGUI` will automatically determine whether the metric is minimized or maximized.\n",
    "\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the evaluation metric results, `spotRiver` considers the time and memory consumption of the online machine learning model. \n",
    "The `spotRiverGUI` will support the user in selecting the time and memory consumption as additional evaluation metrics. By modifying the weight vector, which is shown in the `weights: y, time, mem` field, the user can specify the importance of the evaluation metrics. For example, the weight vector `1,0,0` specifies that only the `y` metric (e.g., accuracy) is considered. The weight vector `0,1,0` specifies that only the time metric is considered. The weight vector `0,0,1` specifies that only the memory metric is considered. The weight vector `1,1,1` specifies that all metrics are considered. \n",
    "\n",
    "::: {.callout-note}\n",
    "#### The weight vector\n",
    "\n",
    "* The specification of adequate weights is highly problem dependent.\n",
    "* There is no generic setting that fits to all problems.\n",
    "\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "As described in @bart23c5, a prediction horizon is used for the comparison of the online-machine learning algorithms.\n",
    "The `horizon` can be specified in the `spotRiverGUI` by the user and is highly problem dependent.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `spotRiverGUI` uses the `eval_oml_horizon` method from the `spotRiver` package, which evaluates the online-machine learning model on a rolling horizon basis. \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the `horizon` value, the user can specify the `oml_grace_period` value. During the `oml_grace_period`, the OML-model is trained on the (small) training data set. No predictions are made during this initial training phase, but the memory and computation time are measured. Then, the OML-model is evaluated on the test data set using a given (sklearn) evaluation metric. \n",
    "The default value of the `oml_grace_period` is `horizon`. For convenience, the value `horizon` is also selected when the user specifies the `oml_grace_period` value as `None`.\n",
    "\n",
    "::: {.callout-note}\n",
    "#### The oml_grace_period\n",
    "\n",
    "* If the `oml_grace_period` is set to the size of the training data set, the OML-model is trained on the entire training data set and then evaluated on the test data set using a given (sklearn) evaluation metric.\n",
    "* This setting might be \"unfair\" in some cases, because the OML-model should learn online and not on the entire training data set.\n",
    "* Therefore, a small data set is recommended for the `oml_grace_period` setting and the prediction `horizon` is a recommended value for the `oml_grace_period` setting. The reader is referred to @bart23c5 for further information about the `oml_grace_period` setting.\n",
