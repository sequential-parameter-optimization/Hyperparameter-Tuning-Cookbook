        "The study begins with a baseline Cessna C172 Skyhawk Aircraft as its reference point. It aims to investigate the impact of wing area and fuel weight on the overall weight of the aircraft. Two crucial parameters in this analysis are the aspect ratio ($A$), defined as the ratio of the wing's length to the average chord (thickness of the airfoil), and the taper ratio ($\\lambda$), which represents the ratio of the maximum to the minimum thickness of the airfoil or the maximum to minimum chord.\n",
        "\n",
        "It's important to note that the equation used in this context is not a computer simulation but will be treated as one for the purpose of illustration. This approach involves employing a true mathematical equation, even if it's considered unknown, as a useful tool for generating realistic settings to test the methodology. The functional form of this equation was derived by \"calibrating\" known physical relationships to curves obtained from existing aircraft data, as referenced in Raymer 2012. Essentially, it acts as a surrogate for actual measurements of aircraft weight.\n",
        "\n",
        "Examining the mathematical properties of the AWWE (Aircraft Weight With Wing Area and Fuel Weight Equation), it is evident that the response is highly nonlinear concerning its inputs. While it's common to apply the logarithm to simplify equations with complex exponents, even when modeling the logarithm, which transforms powers into slope coefficients and products into sums, the response remains nonlinear due to the presence of trigonometric terms. Given the combination of nonlinearity and high input dimension, simple linear and quadratic response surface approximations are likely to be inadequate for this analysis.\n",

        "1. **Understanding**: One of the straightforward objectives is to gain a deep understanding of the input-output relationships in this context. Given the global perspective implied by this setting, it becomes evident that a more sophisticated model is almost necessary. At this stage, let's focus on this specific scenario to establish a clear understanding.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Optimization**: Another application of this analysis could be optimization. There may be an interest in minimizing the weight of the aircraft, but it's likely that there will be constraints in place. For example, the presence of wings with a nonzero area is essential for the aircraft to be capable of flying. In situations involving (constrained) optimization, a global perspective and, consequently, the use of flexible modeling are vital.\n",

        "  1. The load factor $N_z$, which determines the magnitude of the maximum aerodynamic load on the wing, is very active and involved in interactions with other variables.\n",
        "    * Classic example: the interaction of $N_z$ with the aspect ratio $A$ indicates a heavy wing for high aspect ratios and large $g$-forces \n",
        "    * This is the reaon why highly manoeuvrable fighter jets cannot have very efficient, glider wings)\n",
        "  2. Aspect ratio $A$ and airfoil thickness to chord ratio $R_{tc}$ have nonlinear interactions.\n",
        "  3. Most important variables: \n",
        "    * Ultimate load factor $N_z$, wing area $S_w$, and flight design gross weight$W_{dg}$.\n",
        "  4. Little impact: dynamic pressure $q$, taper ratio $l$, and quarter-chord sweep $L$. \n",

        "* Expert Knowledge\n",
        "  * Aircraft designers know that the overall weight of the aircraft and the wing area must be kept to a minimum\n",

        "* Doing the same for all pairs would require 360K evaluations:\n",
        "  * not a reasonable number with a real computer simulation that takes any non-trivial amount of time to evaluate \n",
        "  * Only 1s per evaluation:  $>100$ hours \n",
        "* Many solvers take minutes/hours/days to execute a single run\n",
