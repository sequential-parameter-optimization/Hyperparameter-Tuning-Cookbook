In high-dimensional spaces, the amount of data needed to maintain the same level of accuracy or coverage increases dramatically. For example, if a one-dimensional space requires $n$ samples for a certain accuracy, a $k$-dimensional space would require $n^k$ samples. This makes tasks like optimization, sampling, and modeling computationally expensive and often impractical in high-dimensional settings.\n",

The function $f(x)$ represents a continuous metric (e.g., quality, cost, or performance) defined over a design space $D \\subset \\mathbb{R}^k$, where $x$ is a $k$-dimensional vector of design variables. Since evaluating $f$ is costly, only a sparse set of samples is used to construct $\\hat{f}$, which can then provide inexpensive predictions for any $x \\in D$.\n",

        "* Extreme Sampling: Measuring performance only at the extreme values of parameters may miss important behaviors in the center of the design space, leading to incomplete understanding.\n",
        "* Uneven Sampling: Concentrating samples in certain regions while neglecting others forces the model to extrapolate over unsampled areas, potentially resulting in inaccurate or misleading predictions.\n",
        "Additionally, in some cases, the data may come from external sources or be limited in scope, leaving little control over the sampling plan. This can further restrict the model's ability to generalize effectively.\n",

Additionally, the sampling plan should provide a specified number (e.g., $r$) of elementary effects for each variable, independently drawn with replacement.
