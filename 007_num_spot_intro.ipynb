        "Surrogate model based optimization methods are common approaches in simulation and optimization. SPOT was developed because there is a great need for sound statistical analysis of simulation and optimization algorithms. SPOT includes methods for tuning based on classical regression and analysis of variance techniques.\n",
        "It presents tree-based models such as classification and regression trees and random forests as well as Bayesian optimization (Gaussian process models, also known as Kriging). Combinations of different meta-modeling approaches are possible. SPOT comes with a sophisticated surrogate model based optimization method, that can handle discrete and continuous inputs. Furthermore, any model implemented in `scikit-learn` can be used out-of-the-box as a surrogate in `spotPython`.\n",
        "\n",
        "SPOT implements key techniques such as exploratory fitness landscape analysis and sensitivity analysis. It can be used to understand the performance of various algorithms, while simultaneously giving insights into their algorithmic behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "The `spot` loop consists of the following steps:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Init: Build initial design $X$\n",
        "2. Evaluate initial design on real objective $f$: $y = f(X)$\n",
        "3. Build surrogate: $S = S(X,y)$\n",
        "4. Optimize on surrogate: $X_0 =  \\text{optimize}(S)$\n",
        "5. Evaluate on real objective: $y_0 = f(X_0)$\n",
        "6. Impute (Infill) new points: $X = X \\cup X_0$, $y = y \\cup y_0$.\n",
        "7. Goto 3.\n",
        "\n",
        "Central Idea: Evaluation of the surrogate model `S` is much cheaper (or / and much faster) than running the real-world experiment $f$.\n",
