    "text": "11.0.1 Balancing Exploitation and Exploration\nIn the context of computer experiments and surrogate modeling, a sampling plan refers to the set of input values, often denoted as \\(X\\), at which a computer code is evaluated. The primary objective of a sampling plan is to efficiently explore the input space to understand the behavior of the computer code and to construct a surrogate model that accurately represents that behavior. Historically, Response Surface Methodology (RSM) provided methods for designing such plans, often based on rectangular grids or factorial designs. More recently, Design and Analysis of Computer Experiments (DACE) has emerged as a more flexible and powerful approach for this purpose.\nA surrogate model, or \\(\\hat{f}\\), is built to approximate the expensive response of a black-box function \\(f(x)\\). Since evaluating \\(f\\) is costly, only a sparse set of samples is used to construct \\(\\hat{f}\\), which can then provide inexpensive predictions for any point in the design space. However, as a surrogate model is inherently an approximation of the true function, its accuracy and predictive capabilities can be significantly improved by incorporating new data points, known as infill points. Infill points are strategically chosen to either reduce uncertainty, improve predictions in specific regions of interest, or enhance the model’s ability to identify optima or trends.\nThe process of updating a surrogate model with infill points is iterative. It typically involves: * Identifying Regions of Interest: Analyzing the current surrogate model to determine areas where it is inaccurate, has high uncertainty, or predicts promising results (e.g., potential optima). * Selecting Infill Points: Choosing new data points based on specific criteria that balance different objectives. * Evaluating the True Function: Running the actual simulation or experiment at the selected infill points to obtain their corresponding outputs. * Updating the Surrogate Model: Retraining or updating the surrogate model using the new, augmented dataset. * Repeating: Iterating this process until the model meets predefined accuracy criteria or the computational budget is exhausted.\nA crucial aspect of selecting infill points is navigating the inherent trade-off between exploitation and exploration. * Exploitation refers to sampling near predicted optima to refine the solution. This strategy aims to rapidly converge on a good solution by focusing computational effort where the surrogate model suggests the best values might lie. * Exploration involves sampling in regions of high uncertainty to improve the global accuracy of the model. This approach ensures that the model is well-informed across the entire design space, preventing it from getting stuck in local optima.\nForrester emphasizes that effective infill criteria are designed to combine both exploitation and exploration.",
