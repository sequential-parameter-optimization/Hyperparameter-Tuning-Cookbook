It aims to investigate the impact of wing area and fuel weight on the overall weight of the aircraft. Two crucial parameters in this analysis are the aspect ratio (\\(A\\)), defined as the ratio of the wing’s length to the average chord (thickness of the airfoil), and the taper ratio (\\(\\lambda\\)), which represents the ratio of the maximum to the minimum thickness of the airfoil or the maximum to minimum chord.\nIt’s important to note that the equation used in this context is not a computer simulation but will be treated as one for the purpose of illustration. This approach involves employing a true mathematical equation, even if it’s considered unknown, as a useful tool for generating realistic settings to test the methodology. The functional form of this equation was derived by “calibrating” known physical relationships to curves obtained from existing aircraft data, as referenced in Raymer 2012. Essentially, it acts as a surrogate for actual measurements of aircraft weight.\nExamining the mathematical properties of the AWWE (Aircraft Weight With Wing Area and Fuel Weight Equation), it is evident that the response is highly nonlinear concerning its inputs. While it’s common to apply the logarithm to simplify equations with complex exponents, even when modeling the logarithm, which transforms powers into slope coefficients and products into sums, the response remains nonlinear due to the presence of trigonometric terms. Given the combination of nonlinearity and high input dimension, simple linear and quadratic response surface approximations are likely to be inadequate for this analysis."

    "section": "2.3 Goals: Understanding and Optimization",
    "text": "2.3 Goals: Understanding and Optimization\nThe primary goals of this study revolve around understanding and optimization:\n\nUnderstanding: One of the straightforward objectives is to gain a deep understanding of the input-output relationships in this context. Given the global perspective implied by this setting, it becomes evident that a more sophisticated model is almost necessary. At this stage, let’s focus on this specific scenario to establish a clear understanding.\nOptimization: Another application of this analysis could be optimization. There may be an interest in minimizing the weight of the aircraft, but it’s likely that there will be constraints in place. For example, the presence of wings with a nonzero area is essential for the aircraft to be capable of flying. In situations involving (constrained) optimization, a global perspective and, consequently, the use of flexible modeling are vital.\n\nThe provided Python code serves as a genuine computer implementation that “solves” a mathematical model. It accepts arguments encoded in the unit cube, with defaults used to represent baseline settings, as detailed in the table labeled as Table 2.1. To map values from the interval \\([a, b]\\) to the interval \\([0, 1]\\), the following formula can be employed:\n\\[y = f(x) = \\frac{x - a}{b - a}.\\]\nTo reverse this mapping and obtain the original values, the formula \\[g(y) = a + (b - a) y\\] can be used.\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef wingwt(Sw=0.48, Wfw=0.4, A=0.38, L=0.5, q=0.62, l=0.344,  Rtc=0.4, Nz=0.37, Wdg=0.38):\n    # put coded inputs back on natural scale\n    Sw = Sw * (200 - 150) + 150 \n    Wfw = Wfw * (300 - 220) + 220 \n    A = A * (10 - 6) + 6 \n    L = (L * (10 - (-10)) - 10) * np.pi/180\n    q = q * (45 - 16) + 16 \n    l = l * (1 - 0.5) + 0.5  \n    Rtc = Rtc * (0.18 - 0.08) + 0.08\n    Nz = Nz * (6 - 2.5) + 2.5\n    Wdg = Wdg*(2500 - 1700) + 1700\n    # calculation on natural scale\n    W = 0.036 * Sw**0.758 * Wfw**0.0035 * (A/np.cos(L)**2)**0.6 * q**0.006 \n    W = W * l**0.04 * (100*Rtc/np.cos(L))**(-0.3) * (Nz*Wdg)**(0.49)\n    return(W)"

The approximation error is exceptionally small, effectively approaching machine precision, which indicates the high accuracy of the solver’s results.\nTo simulate time-consuming evaluations, a deliberate delay is introduced by incorporating a sleep(3600) command, which effectively synthesizes a one-hour execution time for a particular evaluation.\nMoving on to the AWWE visualization, plotting in two dimensions is considerably simpler than dealing with nine dimensions. To aid in creating visual representations, the code provided below establishes a grid within the unit square to facilitate the generation of sliced visuals. This involves generating a “meshgrid” as outlined in the code.\n\nimport numpy as np\nx = np.linspace(0, 1, 3)\ny = np.linspace(0, 1, 3)\nX, Y = np.meshgrid(x, y)\nzp = zip(np.ravel(X), np.ravel(Y))\nlist(zp)\n\n[(0.0, 0.0),\n (0.5, 0.0),\n (1.0, 0.0),\n (0.0, 0.5),\n (0.5, 0.5),\n (1.0, 0.5),\n (0.0, 1.0),\n (0.5, 1.0),\n (1.0, 1.0)]\n\n\nThe coding used to transform inputs from natural units is largely a matter of taste, so long as it’s easy to undo for reporting back on original scales\n\n%matplotlib inline\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n# plt.style.use('seaborn-white')\nimport numpy as np\nx = np.linspace(0, 1, 100)\ny = np.linspace(0, 1, 100)\nX, Y = np.meshgrid(x, y)"

The Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) algorithm (selected by setting method='BFGS') is an optimization algorithm that aims to converge quickly to the solution. This algorithm uses the gradient of the objective function. If the gradient is not provided by the user, it is estimated using first-differences. The BFGS method typically requires fewer function calls compared to the simplex algorithm, even when the gradient needs to be estimated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: BFGS\n\n\n\nTo demonstrate the BFGS algorithm, let’s use the Rosenbrock function again. The gradient of the Rosenbrock function is a vector described by the following mathematical expression:\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_j} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} 200(x_i - x_{i-1}^2)(\\delta_{i,j} - 2x_{i-1}\\delta_{i-1,j}) - 2(1 - x_{i-1})\\delta_{i-1,j} \\\\\n= 200(x_j - x_{j-1}^2) - 400x_j(x_{j+1} - x_j^2) - 2(1 - x_j)\n\\end{align}\\]\nThis expression is valid for interior derivatives, but special cases are:\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_0} = -400x_0(x_1 - x_0^2) - 2(1 - x_0)\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_{N-1}} = 200(x_{N-1} - x_{N-2}^2)\n\\]\nHere’s a Python function that computes this gradient:\n\ndef rosen_der(x):\n    xm = x[1:-1]\n    xm_m1 = x[:-2]\n    xm_p1 = x[2:]\n    der = np.zeros_like(x)\n    der[1:-1] = 200*(xm-xm_m1**2) - 400*(xm_p1 - xm**2)*xm - 2*(1-xm)\n    der[0] = -400*x[0]*(x[1]-x[0]**2) - 2*(1-x[0])\n    der[-1] = 200*(x[-1]-x[-2]**2)\n    return der\n\nYou can specify this gradient information in the minimize function using the jac parameter as illustrated below:\n\nres = minimize(rosen, x0, method='BFGS', jac=rosen_der,\n               options={'disp': True})\n\nprint(res.x)\n\nOptimization terminated successfully.\n         Current function value: 0.000000\n         Iterations: 25\n         Function evaluations: 30\n         Gradient evaluations: 30\n[1.00000004 1.0000001  1.00000021 1.00000044 1.00000092]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2.2 Background and Basics for Gradient-based Optimization\n\n\n3.2.3 Gradient\nThe gradient \\(\\nabla f(J)\\) for a scalar function \\(f(J)\\) with \\(n\\) different variables is defined by its partial derivatives:\n\\[\\nabla f(J) = \\left[ \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_1}, \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_2}, \\ldots, \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_n} \\right]\\]\n\n\n3.2.4 Jacobian Matrix\nThe Jacobian matrix \\(J(J)\\) for a vector-valued function \\(F(J) = [f_1(J), f_2(J), \\ldots, f_m(J)]\\) is defined as:\n\\(J(J) = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{\\partial f_1}{\\partial x_1} & \\frac{\\partial f_1}{\\partial x_2} & \\ldots & \\frac{\\partial f_1}{\\partial x_n} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial f_2}{\\partial x_1} & \\frac{\\partial f_2}{\\partial x_2} & \\ldots & \\frac{\\partial f_2}{\\partial x_n} \\\\ \\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\ \\frac{\\partial f_m}{\\partial x_1} & \\frac{\\partial f_m}{\\partial x_2} & \\ldots & \\frac{\\partial f_m}{\\partial x_n} \\end{bmatrix}\\)\nIt consists of the first order partial derivatives and gives therefore an overview about the gradients of a vector valued function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Jacobian matrix\n\n\n\nConsider a vector-valued function \\(f : \\mathbb{R}^2 \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^3\\) defined as follows: \\[f(J) = \\begin{bmatrix} x_1^2 + 2x_2 \\\\ 3x_1 - \\sin(x_2) \\\\ e^{x_1 + x_2} \\end{bmatrix}\\]\nLet’s compute the partial derivatives and construct the Jacobian matrix:\n\\(\\frac{\\partial f_1}{\\partial x_1} = 2x_1, \\quad \\frac{\\partial f_1}{\\partial x_2} = 2\\)\n\\(\\frac{\\partial f_2}{\\partial x_1} = 3, \\quad \\frac{\\partial f_2}{\\partial x_2} = -\\cos(x_2)\\)\n\\(\\frac{\\partial f_3}{\\partial x_1} = e^{x_1 + x_2}, \\quad \\frac{\\partial f_3}{\\partial x_2} = e^{x_1 + x_2}\\)\nSo, the Jacobian matrix is:\n\\[J(J) = \\begin{bmatrix} 2x_1 & 2 \\\\ 3 & -\\cos(x_2) \\\\ e^{x_1 + x_2} & e^{x_1 + x_2} \\end{bmatrix}\\]\nThis Jacobian matrix provides information about how small changes in the input variables \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\) affect the corresponding changes in each component of the output vector.\n\n\n\n\n3.2.5 Hessian Matrix\nThe Hessian matrix \\(H(J)\\) for a scalar function \\(f(J)\\) is defined as:\n\\(H(J) = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x_1^2} & \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x_1 \\partial x_2} & \\ldots & \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x_1 \\partial x_n} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x_2 \\partial x_1} & \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x_2^2} & \\ldots & \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x_2 \\partial x_n} \\\\ \\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\ \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x_n \\partial x_1} & \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x_n \\partial x_2} & \\ldots & \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x_n^2} \\end{bmatrix}\\)\nSo, the Hessian matrix consists of the second order dervatives of the function. It provides information about the local curvature of the function with respect to changes in the input variables.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Hessian matrix\n\n\n\nConsider a scalar-valued function: \\[f(J) = x_1^2 + 2x_2^2 + \\sin(x_1   x_2)\\]\nThe Hessian matrix of this scalar-valued function is the matrix of its second-order partial derivatives with respect to the input variables: \\[H(J) = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x_1^2} & \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x_1 \\partial x_2} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x_2 \\partial x_1} & \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x_2^2} \\end{bmatrix}\\]\nLet’s compute the second-order partial derivatives and construct the Hessian matrix:\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x_1^2} &= 2 + \\cos(x_1 x_2) x_2^2\\\\\n\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x_1 \\partial x_2} &= 2x_1  x_2 \\cos(x_1 x_2) - \\sin(x_1  x_2)\\\\\n\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x_2 \\partial x_1} &= 2x_1  x_2  \\cos(x_1  x_2) - \\sin(x_1  x_2)\\\\\n\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x_2^2} &= 4x_2^2 + \\cos(x_1  x_2) x_1^2\n\\end{align}\\]\nSo, the Hessian matrix is:\n\\[H(J) = \\begin{bmatrix} 2 + \\cos(x_1   x_2)   x_2^2 & 2x_1   x_2   \\cos(x_1   x_2) - \\sin(x_1   x_2) \\\\ 2x_1   x_2   \\cos(x_1   x_2) - \\sin(x_1   x_2) & 4x_2^2 + \\cos(x_1   x_2)   x_1^2 \\end{bmatrix}\\]\n\n\n\n\n3.2.6 Gradient for Optimization\nIn optimization, the goal is to find the minimum or maximum of a function. Gradient-based optimization methods utilize information about the gradient (or derivative) of the function to guide the search for the optimal solution. This is particularly useful when dealing with complex, high-dimensional functions where an exhaustive search is impractical.\nThe gradient descent method can be divided in the following steps:\n\nInitialize: start with an initial guess for the parameters of the function to be optimized.\nCompute Gradient: Calculate the gradient (partial derivatives) of the function with respect to each parameter at the current point. The gradient indicates the direction of the steepest increase in the function.\nUpdate Parameters: Adjust the parameters in the opposite direction of the gradient, scaled by a learning rate. This step aims to move towards the minimum of the function:\n\n\\(x_{k+1} = x_k - \\alpha \\times \\nabla f(x_{k})\\)\n\\(x_{x}\\) is current parameter vector or point in the parameter space.\n\\(\\alpha\\) is the learning rate, a positive scalar that determines the step size in each iteration.\n\\(\\nabla f(x)\\) is the gradient of the objective function.\n\nIterate: Repeat the above steps until convergence or a predefined number of iterations. Convergence is typically determined when the change in the function value or parameters becomes negligible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Gradient Descent\n\n\n\nLet’s consider a simple quadratic function as an example: \\[f(x) = x^2 + 4x + y^2 + 2y + 4.\\]\nWe’ll use gradient descent to find the minimum of this function.\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom mpl_toolkits.mplot3d import Axes3D\n\n# Define the quadratic function\ndef quadratic_function(x, y):\n    return x**2 + 4*x + y**2 + 2*y + 4\n\n# Define the gradient of the quadratic function\ndef gradient_quadratic_function(x, y):\n    grad_x = 2*x + 4\n    grad_y = 2*y + 2\n    return np.array([grad_x, grad_y])\n\n# Gradient Descent for optimization in 2D\ndef gradient_descent(initial_point, learning_rate, num_iterations):\n    points = [np.array(initial_point)]\n    \n    for _ in range(num_iterations):\n        current_point = points[-1]\n        gradient = gradient_quadratic_function(*current_point)\n        new_point = current_point - learning_rate * gradient\n        \n        points.append(new_point)\n        \n    return points\n\n# Visualization of optimization process with 3D surface and consistent arrow sizes\ndef plot_optimization_process_3d_consistent_arrows(points):\n    fig = plt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))\n    ax = fig.add_subplot(111, projection='3d')\n\n    x_vals = np.linspace(-10, 2, 100)\n    y_vals = np.linspace(-10, 2, 100)\n    X, Y = np.meshgrid(x_vals, y_vals)\n    Z = quadratic_function(X, Y)\n\n    ax.plot_surface(X, Y, Z, cmap='viridis', alpha=0.6)\n    ax.scatter(*zip(*points), [quadratic_function(*p) for p in points], c='red', label='Optimization Trajectory')\n\n    for i in range(len(points) - 1):  \n        x, y = points[i]\n        dx, dy = points[i + 1] - points[i]\n        dz = quadratic_function(*(points[i + 1])) - quadratic_function(*points[i])\n        gradient_length = 0.5\n\n        ax.quiver(x, y, quadratic_function(*points[i]), dx, dy, dz, color='blue', length=gradient_length, normalize=False, arrow_length_ratio=0.1)\n\n    ax.set_title('Gradient-Based Optimization with 2D Quadratic Function')\n    ax.set_xlabel('x')\n    ax.set_ylabel('y')\n    ax.set_zlabel('f(x, y)')\n    ax.legend()\n    plt.show()\n\n# Initial guess and parameters\ninitial_guess = [-9.0, -9.0]\nlearning_rate = 0.2\nnum_iterations = 10\n\n# Run gradient descent in 2D and visualize the optimization process with 3D surface and consistent arrow sizes\ntrajectory = gradient_descent(initial_guess, learning_rate, num_iterations)\nplot_optimization_process_3d_consistent_arrows(trajectory)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2.7 Newton Method\nInitialization: Start with an initial guess for the optimal solution: \\(x_0\\).\nIteration: Repeat the following three steps until convergence or a predefined stopping criterion is met:\n\nCalculate the gradient (\\(\\nabla\\)) and the Hessian matrix (\\(\\nabla^2\\)) of the objective function at the current point: \\[\\nabla f(x_k) \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\nabla^2 f(x_k)\\]\nUpdate the current solution using the Newton-Raphson update formula \\[x_{k+1} = x_k - [\\nabla^2 f(x_k)]^{-1} \\nabla f(x_k),\\] where\n\n\n\\(\\nabla f(x_k)\\) is the gradient (first derivative) of the objective function with respect to the variable \\(x\\), evaluated at the current solution \\(x_k\\).\n\\(\\nabla^2 f(x_k)\\): The Hessian matrix (second derivative) of the objective function with respect to \\(x\\), evaluated at the current solution \\(x_k\\).\n\\(x_k\\): The current solution or point in the optimization process.\n\\(\\nabla^2 f(x_k)]^{-1}\\): The inverse of the Hessian matrix at the current point, representing the approximation of the curvature of the objective function.\n\\(x_{k+1}\\): The updated solution or point after applying the Newton-Raphson update.\n\n\nCheck for convergence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Newton Method\n\n\n\nWe want to optimize the Rosenbrock function and use the Hessian and the Jacobian (which is equal to the gradient vector for scalar objective function) to the minimize function.\n\ndef rosenbrock(x):\n    return 100 * (x[1] - x[0]**2)**2 + (1 - x[0])**2\n\ndef rosenbrock_gradient(x):\n    dfdx0 = -400 * x[0] * (x[1] - x[0]**2) - 2 * (1 - x[0])\n    dfdx1 = 200 * (x[1] - x[0]**2)\n    return np.array([dfdx0, dfdx1])\n\ndef rosenbrock_hessian(x):\n    d2fdx0 = 1200 * x[0]**2 - 400 * x[1] + 2\n    d2fdx1 = -400 * x[0]\n    return np.array([[d2fdx0, d2fdx1], [d2fdx1, 200]])\n\ndef classical_newton_optimization_2d(initial_guess, tol=1e-6, max_iter=100):\n    x = initial_guess.copy()\n\n    for i in range(max_iter):\n        gradient = rosenbrock_gradient(x)\n        hessian = rosenbrock_hessian(x)\n\n        # Solve the linear system H * d = -g for d\n        d = np.linalg.solve(hessian, -gradient)\n\n        # Update x\n        x += d\n\n        # Check for convergence\n        if np.linalg.norm(gradient, ord=np.inf) &lt;

    "text": "3.4 Global Optimization\nGlobal optimization aims to find the global minimum of a function within given bounds, in the presence of potentially many local minima. Typically, global minimizers efficiently search the parameter space, while using a local minimizer (e.g., minimize) under the hood. SciPy contains a number of good global optimizers. Here, we’ll use those on the same objective function, namely the (aptly named) eggholder function:\n\ndef eggholder(x):\n    return (-(x[1] + 47) * np.sin(np.sqrt(abs(x[0]/2 + (x[1]  + 47))))\n            -x[0] * np.sin(np.sqrt(abs(x[0] - (x[1]  + 47)))))\n\nbounds = [(-512, 512), (-512, 512)]\n\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom mpl_toolkits.mplot3d import Axes3D\n\nx = np.arange(-512, 513)\ny = np.arange(-512, 513)\nxgrid, ygrid = np.meshgrid(x, y)\nxy = np.stack([xgrid, ygrid])\n\nfig = plt.figure()\nax = fig.add_subplot(111, projection='3d')\nax.view_init(45, -45)\nax.plot_surface(xgrid, ygrid, eggholder(xy), cmap='terrain')\nax.set_xlabel('x')\nax.set_ylabel('y')\nax.set_zlabel('eggholder(x, y)')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\nWe now use the global optimizers to obtain the minimum and the function value at the minimum.

    "text": "5.1 Response Surface Methods: What is RSM?\nResponse Surface Methods (RSM) refer to a collection of statistical and mathematical tools that are valuable for developing, improving, and optimizing processes. The overarching theme of RSM involves studying how input variables that control a product or process can potentially influence a response that measures performance or quality characteristics.\nThe advantages of RSM include a rich literature, well-established methods often used in manufacturing, the importance of careful experimental design combined with a well-understood model, and the potential to add significant value to scientific inquiry, process refinement, optimization, and more. However, there are also drawbacks to RSM, such as the use of simple and crude surrogates, the hands-on nature of the methods, and the limitation of local methods.\nRSM is related to various fields, including Design of Experiments (DoE), quality management, reliability, and productivity. Its applications are widespread in industry and manufacturing, focusing on designing, developing, and formulating new products and improving existing ones, as well as from laboratory research. RSM is commonly applied in domains such as materials science, manufacturing, applied chemistry, climate science, and many others.\nAn example of RSM involves studying the relationship between a response variable, such as yield (\\(y\\)) in a chemical process, and two process variables: reaction time (\\(\\xi_1\\)) and reaction temperature (\\(\\xi_2\\)). The provided code illustrates this scenario, following a variation of the so-called “banana function.”\nIn the context of visualization, RSM offers the choice between 3D plots and contour plots. In a 3D plot, the independent variables \\(\\xi_1\\) and \\(\\xi_2\\) are represented, with \\(y\\) as the dependent variable.\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\ndef fun_rosen(x1, x2):\n    b = 10\n    return (x1-1)**2 + b*(x2-x1**2)**2\n\nfig = plt.figure()\nax = fig.add_subplot(111, projection='3d')\nx = np.arange(-2.0, 2.0, 0.05)\ny = np.arange(-1.0, 3.0, 0.05)\nX, Y = np.meshgrid(x, y)\nzs = np.array(fun_rosen(np.ravel(X), np.ravel(Y)))\nZ = zs.reshape(X.shape)\n\nax.plot_surface(X, Y, Z)\n\nax.set_xlabel('X1')\nax.set_ylabel('X2')\nax.set_zlabel('Y')\n\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\ncontour plot example:\n\n\\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\) are the independent variables\n\\(y\\) is the dependent variable\n\n\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.cm as cm\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\ndelta = 0.025\nx1 = np.arange(-2.0, 2.0, delta)\nx2 = np.arange(-1.0, 3.0, delta)\nX1, X2 = np.meshgrid(x1, x2)\nY = fun_rosen(X1, X2)\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\nCS = ax.contour(X1, X2, Y , 50)\nax.clabel(CS, inline=True, fontsize=10)\nax.set_title(\"Rosenbrock's Banana Function\")\n\nText(0.5, 1.0, \"Rosenbrock's Banana Function\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVisual inspection: yield is optimized near \\((\\xi_1. \\xi_2)\\)\n\n\n5.1.1 Visualization: Problems in Practice\n\nTrue response surface is unknown in practice\nWhen yield evaluation is not as simple as a toy banana function, but a process requiring care to monitor, reconfigure and run, it’s far too expensive to observe over a dense grid\nAnd, measuring yield may be a noisy/inexact process\nThat’s where stats (RSM) comes in\n\n\n\n5.1.2 RSM: Strategies\n\nRSMs consist of experimental strategies for\nexploring the space of the process (i.e., independent/input) variables (above \\(\\xi_1\\) and \\(\\xi2)\\)\nempirical statistical modeling targeted toward development of an appropriate approximating relationship between the response (yield) and process variables local to a study region of interest\noptimization methods for sequential refinement in search of the levels or values of process variables that produce desirable responses (e.g., that maximize yield or explain variation)\nRSM used for fitting an Empirical Model\nTrue response surface driven by an unknown physical mechanism\nObservations corrupted by noise\nHelpful: fit an empirical model to output collected under different process configurations\nConsider response \\(Y\\) that depends on controllable input variables \\(\\xi_1, \\xi_2, \\ldots, \\xi_m\\)\nRSM: Equations of the Empirical Model\n\n\\(Y=f(\\xi_1, \\xi_2, \\ldots, \\xi_m) + \\epsilon\\)\n\\(\\mathbb{E}\\{Y\\} = \\eta = f(\\xi1_1, \\xi_2, \\ldots, \\xi_m)\\)\n\\(\\epsilon\\) is treated as zero mean idiosyncratic noise possibly representing\n\ninherent variation, or\nthe effect of other systems or\nvariables not under our purview at this time\n\n\n\n\n\n5.1.3 RSM: Noise in the Empirical Model\n\nTypical simplifying assumption: \\(\\epsilon \\sim N(0,\\sigma^2)\\)\nWe seek estimates for \\(f\\) and \\(\\sigma^2\\) from noisy observations \\(Y\\) at inputs \\(\\xi\\)\n\n\n\n5.1.4 RSM: Natural and Coded Variables\n\nInputs \\(\\xi_1, \\xi_2, \\ldots, \\xi_m\\) called natural variables:\n\nexpressed in natural units of measurement, e.g., degrees Celsius, pounds per square inch (psi), etc.\n\nTransformed to coded variables \\(x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_m\\):\n\nto mitigate hassles and confusion that can arise when working with a multitude of scales of measurement\n\nTypical Transformations offering dimensionless inputs \\(x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_m\\)\n\nin the unit cube, or\nscaled to have a mean of zero and standard deviation of one, are common choices.\n\nEmpirical model becomes \\(\\eta = f(x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_m)\\)\n\n\n\n5.1.5 RSM Low-order Polynomials\n\nLow-order polynomial make the following simplifying Assumptions\n\nLearning about \\(f\\) is lots easier if we make some simplifying approximations\nAppealing to Taylor’s theorem, a low-order polynomial in a small, localized region of the input (\\(x\\)) space is one way forward\nClassical RSM:\n\ndisciplined application of local analysis and\nsequential refinement of locality through conservative extrapolation\n\nInherently a hands-on process"

    "section": "6.1 DACE and RSM",
    "text": "6.1 DACE and RSM\nMathematical models implemented in computer codes are used to circumvent the need for expensive field data collection. These models are particularly useful when dealing with highly nonlinear response surfaces, high signal-to-noise ratios (which often involve deterministic evaluations), and a global scope. As a result, a new approach is required in comparison to Response Surface Methodology (RSM).\nWith the improvement in computing power and simulation fidelity, researchers gain higher confidence and a better understanding of the dynamics in physical, biological, and social systems. However, the expansion of configuration spaces and increasing input dimensions necessitates more extensive designs. High-performance computing (HPC) allows for thousands of runs, whereas previously only tens were possible. This shift towards larger models and training data presents new computational challenges.\nResearch questions for DACE (Design and Analysis of Computer Experiments) include how to design computer experiments that make efficient use of computation and how to meta-model computer codes to save on simulation effort. The choice of surrogate model for computer codes significantly impacts the optimal experiment design, and the preferred model-design pairs can vary depending on the specific goal.\nThe combination of computer simulation, design, and modeling with field data from similar real-world experiments introduces a new category of computer model tuning problems. The ultimate goal is to automate these processes to the greatest extent possible, allowing for the deployment of HPC with minimal human intervention.\nOne of the remaining differences between RSM and DACE lies in how they handle noise. DACE employs replication, a technique that would not be used in a deterministic setting, to separate signal from noise. Traditional RSM is best suited for situations where a substantial proportion of the variability in the data is due to noise, and where the acquisition of data values can be severely limited. Consequently, RSM is better suited for a different class of problems, aligning with its intended purposes.\n\n6.1.1 DACE Literature\nTwo very good texts on computer experiments and surrogate modeling are Santner, Williams, and Notz (2003) and Forrester, Sóbester, and Keane (2008). The former is the canonical reference in the statistics literature and the latter is perhaps more popular in engineering."

    "section": "6.2 Background: Expectation, Mean",
    "text": "6.2 Background: Expectation, Mean\nThe distribution of a random vector is characterized by some indexes. One of them is the expected value, which is defined as \\[\nE[X] = \\sum_{x \\in D_X} xp_X(x)  \\qquad \\text{if $X$ is discrete}\n\\] \\[\nE[X] = \\int\\limits_{x \\in D_X} xf_X(x)\\mathrm{d}x  \\quad  \\text{if $X$ is continuous.}\n\\]\nThe mean, \\(\\mu\\), of a probability distribution is a measure of its central tendency or location. That is, \\(E(X)\\) is defined as the average of all possible values of \\(X\\), weighted by their probabilities.\n\n6.2.1 Example\nLet \\(X\\) denote the number produced by rolling a fair die. Then \\[\nE(X) = 1 \\times 1/6 + 2 \\times 1/6 + 3 \\times 1/6 + 4 \\times 1/6 + 5 \\times 1/6 + 6\\times 1/6 = 3.5\n\\]\n\n\n6.2.2 Sample Mean\nThe sample mean is an important estimate of the population mean. The sample mean of a sample \\(\\{x_i\\}\\) (\\(i=1,2,\\ldots,n\\)) is defined as \\[\\overline{x}  = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_i x_i.\\]\n\n\n6.2.3 Variance and Standard Deviation\nIf we are trying to predict the value of a random variable \\(X\\) by its mean \\(\\mu = E(X)\\), the error will be \\(X-\\mu\\). In many situations it is useful to have an idea how large this deviation or error is. Since \\(E(X-\\mu) = E(X) -\\mu = 0\\), it is necessary to use the absolute value or the square of (\\(X-\\mu\\)). The squared error is the first choice, because the derivatives are easier to calculate. These considerations motivate the definition of the variance:\nThe variance of a random variable \\(X\\) is the mean squared deviation of \\(X\\) from its expected value \\(\\mu = E(X)\\). \\[\\begin{equation}\nVar(X) = E[ (X-\\mu)^2].\n\\end{equation}\\]\n\n\n6.2.4 Standard Deviation\nTaking the square root of the variance to get back to the same scale of units as \\(X\\) gives the standard deviation. The standard deviation of \\(X\\) is the square root of the variance of \\(X\\). \\[\\begin{equation}\nsd(X) = \\sqrt{Var(X)}.\n\\end{equation}\\]\n\n\n6.2.5 Calculation of the Standard Deviation with Python\nThe function numpy.std returns the standard deviation, a measure of the spread of a distribution, of the array elements. The argument ddof specifies the Delta Degrees of Freedom. The divisor used in calculations is N - ddof, where N represents the number of elements. By default ddof is zero, i.e., std uses the formula \\[\\begin{equation}  \\sqrt{  \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_i \\left( x_i - \\bar{x} \\right)^2  } \\qquad \\text{with } \\quad \\bar{x} = \\sum_{i=1}^N x_i /N. \\end{equation}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Standard Deviation with Python\n\n\n\nConsider the array \\([1,2,3]\\): Since \\(\\bar{x} = 2\\), the following value is computed: \\[ \\sqrt{1/3 \\times \\left( (1-2)^2 + (2-2)^2 + (3-2)^2  \\right)} = \\sqrt{2/3}.\\]\n\nimport numpy as np\na = np.array([[1, 2, 3]])\nnp.std(a)\n\n0.816496580927726\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.2.6 The Empirical Standard Deviation\nThe empirical standard deviation (which uses \\(N-1\\)), \\(\\sqrt{1/2 \\times \\left( (1-2)^2 + (2-2)^2 + (3-2)^2 \\right)} = \\sqrt{2/2}\\), can be calculated as follows:\n\nnp.std(a, ddof=1)\n\n1.0\n\n\n\n\n6.2.7 The Argument “axis”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAxes along which the standard deviation is computed\n\n\n\n\nWhen you compute np.std with axis=0, it calculates the standard deviation along the vertical axis, meaning it computes the standard deviation for each column of the array.\nOn the other hand, when you compute np.std with axis=1, it calculates the standard deviation along the horizontal axis, meaning it computes the standard deviation for each row of the array.\nIf the axis parameter is not specified, np.std computes the standard deviation of the flattened array.\n\n\n\n\nA = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])\nA\n\narray([[1, 2],\n       [3, 4]])\n\n\n\nnp.std(A)\n\n1.118033988749895\n\n\n\nnp.std(A, axis=0)\n\narray([1., 1.])\n\n\n\nnp.std(A, axis=1)\n\narray([0.5, 0.5])\n\n\n\n\n6.2.8 Single Versus Double Precision\nIn single precision, std() can be inaccurate:\n\na = np.zeros((2, 4*4), dtype=np.float32)\na[0, :] = 1.0\na[1, :] = 0.1\na \n\narray([[1. , 1. , 1. , 1. , 1. , 1. , 1. , 1. , 1. , 1. , 1. , 1. , 1. ,\n        1. , 1. , 1. ],\n       [0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1,\n        0.1, 0.1, 0.1]], dtype=float32)\n\n\n\nnp.std(a, axis=0)\n\narray([0.45, 0.45, 0.45, 0.45, 0.45, 0.45, 0.45, 0.45, 0.45, 0.45, 0.45,\n       0.45, 0.45, 0.45, 0.45, 0.45], dtype=float32)\n\n\n\nnp.std(a, axis=1)\n\narray([0., 0.], dtype=float32)\n\n\n\nabs(0.45 - np.std(a))\n\n1.7881393421514957e-08\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFloat data types\n\n\n\n\nfloat32 and float64 are data types in numpy that specify the precision of floating point numbers.\nfloat32 is a single-precision floating point number that occupies 32 bits of memory. It has a precision of about 7 decimal digits.\nfloat64 is a double-precision floating point number that occupies 64 bits of memory. It has a precision of about 15 decimal digits.\nThe main difference between float32 and float64 is the precision and memory usage. float64 provides a higher precision but uses more memory, while float32 uses less memory but has a lower precision.\n\n\n\nComputing the standard deviation in float64 is more accurate (result may vary), see https://numpy.org/devdocs/reference/generated/numpy.std.html.\n\nabs(0.45 - np.std(a, dtype=np.float64))\n\n7.450580707946131e-10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: 32 versus 64 bit\n\n\n\n\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define a number\nnum = 0.123456789123456789\n\n# Convert to float32 and float64\nnum_float32 = np.float32(num)\nnum_float64 = np.float64(num)\n\n# Print the number in both formats\nprint(\"float32: \", num_float32)\nprint(\"float64: \", num_float64)\n\nfloat32:  0.12345679\nfloat64:  0.12345678912345678\n\n\n\n\nThe float32 data type in numpy represents a single-precision floating point number. It uses 32 bits of memory, which gives it a precision of about 7 decimal digits. On the other hand, float64 represents a double-precision floating point number. It uses 64 bits of memory, which gives it a precision of about 15 decimal digits.\nThe reason float32 shows fewer digits is because it has less precision due to using less memory. The bits of memory are used to store the sign, exponent, and fraction parts of the floating point number, and with fewer bits, you can represent fewer digits accurately."

    "text": "6.8 The Multivariate Normal Distribution\nThe multivariate normal, multinormal, or Gaussian distribution serves as a generalization of the one-dimensional normal distribution to higher dimensions. We will consider \\(k\\)-dimensional random vectors \\(X = (X_1, X_2, \\ldots, X_k)\\). When drawing samples from this distribution, it results in a set of values represented as \\(\\{x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_k\\}\\). To fully define this distribution, it is necessary to specify its mean \\(\\mu\\) and covariance matrix \\(\\Sigma\\). These parameters are analogous to the mean, which represents the central location, and the variance (squared standard deviation) of the one-dimensional normal distribution introduced in Equation 6.1.\nIn the context of the multivariate normal distribution, the mean takes the form of a coordinate within an \\(k\\)-dimensional space. This coordinate represents the location where samples are most likely to be generated, akin to the peak of the bell curve in a one-dimensional or univariate normal distribution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCovariance of two random variables\n\n\n\nFor two random variables \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\), the covariance is defined as the expected value (or mean) of the product of their deviations from their individual expected values: \\[\n\\operatorname{cov}(X, Y) = \\operatorname{E}{\\big[(X - \\operatorname{E}[X])(Y - \\operatorname{E}[Y])\\big]}\n\\]\nThe covariance within the multivariate normal distribution denotes the extent to which two variables vary together. The elements of the covariance matrix, such as \\(\\Sigma_{ij}\\), represent the covariances between the variables \\(x_i\\) and \\(x_j\\). These covariances describe how the different variables in the distribution are related to each other in terms of their variability.\nThe probability density function (PDF) of the multivariate normal distribution is defined as: \\[\nf_X(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{(2\\pi)^n \\det(\\Sigma)}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{2} (x-\\mu)^T\\Sigma^{-1} (x-\\mu)\\right),\n\\] where: \\(\\mu\\) is the \\(k \\times 1\\) mean vector; \\(\\Sigma\\) is the \\(k \\times k\\) covariance matrix. The covariance matrix \\(\\Sigma\\) is assumed to be positive definite, so that its determinant is strictly positive.\nFor discrete random variables, covariance can be written as: \\[\n\\operatorname{cov} (X,Y) = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i-E(X)) (y_i-E(Y)).\n\\]\n\n\nFigure 6.1 shows draws from a bivariate normal distribution with \\(\\mu = \\begin{pmatrix}0 \\\\ 0\\end{pmatrix}\\) and \\(\\Sigma=\\begin{pmatrix} 9 & 4 \\\\ 4 & 9 \\end{pmatrix}\\).\n\nimport numpy as np\nrng = np.random.default_rng()\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nmean = [0, 0]\ncov = [[9, 4], [4, 9]]  # diagonal covariance\nx, y = rng.multivariate_normal(mean, cov, 1000).T\n# Create a scatter plot of the numbers\nplt.scatter(x, y, s=2)\nplt.axis('equal')\nplt.grid()\nplt.title(f\"Bivariate Normal.

They determine the spread of the distribution along each axis. A larger variance corresponds to a greater spread along that axis.\nThe off-diagonal elements of the covariance matrix (\\(\\sigma_{12}, \\sigma_{21}\\)) are the covariances between the variables. They determine the orientation and shape of the distribution. If the covariance is positive, the distribution is stretched along the line \\(y=x\\), indicating that the variables tend to increase together. If the covariance is negative, the distribution is stretched along the line \\(y=-x\\), indicating that one variable tends to decrease as the other increases. If the covariance is zero, the variables are uncorrelated and the distribution is axis-aligned.\nIn Figure 6.1, the variances are identical and the variables are correlated (covariance is 4), so the distribution is stretched along the line \\(y=x\\).\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom scipy.stats import multivariate_normal\n\n# Parameters\nmu = np.array([0, 0])\ncov = np.array([[9, 4], [4, 9]])\n\n# Create grid and multivariate normal\nx = np.linspace(-10,10,100)\ny = np.linspace(-10,10,100)\nX, Y = np.meshgrid(x,y)\npos = np.empty(X.shape + (2,))\npos[:, :, 0] = X; pos[:, :, 1] = Y\nrv = multivariate_normal(mu, cov)\n\nfig = plt.figure()\nax = plt.axes(projection='3d')  \nsurf=ax.plot_surface(X, Y, rv.pdf(pos),cmap='viridis',linewidth=0)\nax.set_xlabel('X axis')\nax.set_ylabel('Y axis')\nax.set_zlabel('Z axis')\nax.set_title('Bivariate Normal Distribution')\nfig.colorbar(surf, shrink=0.5, aspect=10)\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.2: Bivariate Normal.

    "section": "6.11 Introduction to Gaussian Processes",
    "text": "6.11 Introduction to Gaussian Processes\nThe concept of GP (Gaussian Process) regression can be understood as a simple extension of linear modeling. It is worth noting that this approach goes by various names and acronyms, including “kriging,” a term derived from geostatistics, as introduced by Matheron in 1963. Additionally, it is referred to as Gaussian spatial modeling or a Gaussian stochastic process, and machine learning (ML) researchers often use the term Gaussian process regression (GPR). In all of these instances, the central focus is on regression. This involves training on both inputs and outputs, with the ultimate objective of making predictions and quantifying uncertainty (referred to as uncertainty quantification or UQ).\nHowever, it’s important to emphasize that GPs are not a universal solution for every problem. Specialized tools may outperform GPs in specific, non-generic contexts, and GPs have their own set of limitations that need to be considered.\n\n6.11.1 Gaussian Process Prior\nIn the context of GP, any finite collection of realizations, which is represented by \\(n\\) observations, is modeled as having a multivariate normal (MVN) distribution. The characteristics of these realizations can be fully described by two key parameters:\n\nTheir mean, denoted as an \\(n\\)-vector \\(\\mu\\).\nThe covariance matrix, denoted as an \\(n \\times n\\) matrix \\(\\Sigma\\). This covariance matrix encapsulates the relationships and variability between the individual realizations within the collection.\n\n\n\n6.11.2 Covariance Function\nThe covariance function is defined by inverse exponentiated squared Euclidean distance: \\[\n\\Sigma(\\vec{x}, \\vec{x}') = \\exp\\{ - || \\vec{x} - \\vec{x}'||^2 \\},\n\\] where \\(\\vec{x}\\) and \\(\\vec{x}'\\) are two points in the \\(k\\)-dimensional input space and \\(\\| \\cdot \\|\\) denotes the Euclidean distance, i.e., \\[\n|| \\vec{x} - \\vec{x}'||^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^k (x_i - x_i')^2.\n\\]\nAn 1-d example is shown in Figure 6.5.\n\nvisualize_inverse_exp_squared_distance(5, 0.0, [0.5, 1, 2.0])\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.5: One-dim inverse exponentiated squared Euclidean distance\n\n\n\n\nThe covariance function is also referred to as the kernel function. The Gaussian kernel uses an additional parameter, \\(\\sigma^2\\), to control the rate of decay. This parameter is referred to as the length scale or the characteristic length scale. The covariance function is then defined as\n\\[\n\\Sigma(\\vec{x}, \\vec{x}') = \\exp\\{ - || \\vec{x} - \\vec{x}'||^2 / (2 \\sigma^2) \\}.\n\\tag{6.2}\\]\nThe covariance decays exponentially fast as \\(\\vec{x}\\) and \\(\\vec{x}'\\) become farther apart. Observe that\n\\[\n\\Sigma(\\vec{x},\\vec{x}) = 1\n\\] and\n\\[\n\\Sigma(\\vec{x}, \\vec{x}') &lt; 1\n\\] for \\(\\vec{x} \\neq \\vec{x}'\\). The function \\(\\Sigma(\\vec{x},\\vec{x}')\\) must be positive definite.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPositive Definiteness\n\n\n\nPositive definiteness in the context of the covariance matrix \\(\\Sigma_n\\) is a fundamental requirement. It is determined by evaluating \\(\\Sigma(x_i, x_j)\\) at pairs of \\(n\\) \\(\\vec{x}\\)-values, denoted as \\(\\vec{x}_1, \\vec{x}_2, \\ldots, \\vec{x}_n\\). The condition for positive definiteness is that for all \\(\\vec{x}\\) vectors that are not equal to zero, the expression \\(\\vec{x}^\\top \\Sigma_n \\vec{x}\\) must be greater than zero. This property is essential when intending to use \\(\\Sigma_n\\) as a covariance matrix in multivariate normal (MVN) analysis. It is analogous to the requirement in univariate Gaussian distributions where the variance parameter, \\(\\sigma^2\\), must be positive.\n\n\nGaussian Processes (GPs) can be effectively utilized to generate random data that follows a smooth functional relationship. The process involves the following steps:\n\nSelect a set of \\(\\vec{x}\\)-values, denoted as \\(\\vec{x}_1, \\vec{x}_2, \\ldots, \\vec{x}_n\\).\nDefine the covariance matrix \\(\\Sigma_n\\) by evaluating \\(\\Sigma_n^{ij} = \\Sigma(\\vec{x}_i, \\vec{x}_j)\\) for \\(i, j = 1, 2, \\ldots, n\\).\nGenerate an \\(n\\)-variate realization \\(Y\\) that follows a multivariate normal distribution with a mean of zero and a covariance matrix \\(\\Sigma_n\\), expressed as \\(Y \\sim \\mathcal{N}_n(0, \\Sigma_n)\\).\nVisualize the result by plotting it in the \\(x\\)-\\(y\\) plane.\n\n\n\n6.11.3 Construction of the Covariance Matrix\nHere is an one-dimensional example. The process begins by creating an input grid using \\(\\vec{x}\\)-values. This grid consists of 100 elements, providing the basis for further analysis and visualization.\n\nimport numpy as np\nn = 100\nX = np.linspace(0, 10, n, endpoint=False).reshape(-1,1)\n\nIn the context of this discussion, the construction of the covariance matrix, denoted as \\(\\Sigma_n\\), relies on the concept of inverse exponentiated squared Euclidean distances. However, it’s important to note that a modification is introduced later in the process. Specifically, the diagonal of the covariance matrix is augmented with a small value, represented as “eps” or \\(\\epsilon\\).\nThe reason for this augmentation is that while inverse exponentiated distances theoretically ensure the covariance matrix’s positive definiteness, in practical applications, the matrix can sometimes become numerically ill-conditioned. By adding a small value to the diagonal, such as \\(\\epsilon\\), this ill-conditioning issue is mitigated. In this context, \\(\\epsilon\\) is often referred to as “jitter.”\n\nimport numpy as np\nfrom numpy import array, zeros, power, ones, exp, multiply, eye, linspace, mat, spacing, sqrt, arange, append, ravel\nfrom numpy.linalg import cholesky, solve\nfrom numpy.random import multivariate_normal\ndef build_Sigma(X, sigma2):\n    n = X.shape[0]\n    k = X.shape[1]\n    D = zeros((k, n, n))\n    for l in range(k):\n        for i in range(n):\n            for j in range(i, n):\n                D[l, i, j] = 1/(2*sigma2[l])*(X[i,l] - X[j,l])**2\n    D = sum(D)\n    D = D + D.T\n    return exp(-D)  \n\n\nsigma2 = np.array([1.0])\nSigma = build_Sigma(X, sigma2)\nnp.round(Sigma[:3,:], 3)\n\narray([[1.   , 0.995, 0.98 , 0.956, 0.923, 0.882, 0.835, 0.783, 0.726,\n        0.667, 0.607, 0.546, 0.487, 0.43 , 0.375, 0.325, 0.278, 0.236,\n        0.198, 0.164, 0.135, 0.11 , 0.089, 0.071, 0.056, 0.044, 0.034,\n        0.026, 0.02 , 0.015, 0.011, 0.008, 0.006, 0.004, 0.003, 0.002,\n        0.002, 0.001, 0.001, 0.   , 0.   , 0.   , 0.   , 0.   , 0.   ,\n        0.   , 0.   , 0.   , 0.   , 0.   , 0.   , 0.   , 0.   , 0.   ,\n        0.   , 0.   , 0.   , 0.   , 0.   , 0.   , 0.   , 0.   , 0.   ,\n        0.   , 0.   , 0.   , 0.   , 0.   , 0.   , 0.   , 0.   , 0.   ,\n        0.   , 0.   , 0.   , 0.   , 0.   , 0.   , 0.   , 0.   , 0.   ,\n        0.   , 0.   , 0.   , 0.   , 0.   , 0.   , 0.   , 0.   , 0.   ,\n        0.   , 0.   , 0.   , 0.   , 0.   , 0.   , 0.   , 0.   , 0.   ,\n        0.   ],\n       [0.995, 1.   , 0.995, 0.98 , 0.956, 0.923, 0.882, 0.835, 0.783,\n        0.726, 0.667, 0.607, 0.546, 0.487, 0.43 , 0.375, 0.325, 0.278,\n        0.236, 0.198, 0.164, 0.135, 0.11 , 0.089, 0.071, 0.056, 0.044,\n        0.034, 0.026, 0.02 , 0.015, 0.011, 0.008, 0.006, 0.004, 0.003,\n        0.002, 0.002, 0.001, 0.001, 0.   , 0.   , 0.   , 0.   , 0.   ,\n        0.   , 0.   , 0.   , 0.   , 0.   , 0.   , 0.   , 0.   , 0.   ,\n        0.   , 0.   , 0.   , 0.   , 0.   , 0.   , 0.   , 0.   , 0.   ,\n        0.   , 0.   , 0.   , 0.   , 0.   , 0.   , 0.   , 0.   , 0.   ,\n        0.   , 0.   , 0.   , 0.   , 0.   , 0.   , 0.   , 0.   , 0.   ,\n        0.   , 0.   , 0.   , 0.   , 0.   , 0.   , 0.   , 0.   , 0.   ,\n        0.   , 0.   , 0.   , 0.   , 0.   , 0.   , 0.   , 0.   , 0.   ,\n        0.   ],\n       [0.98 , 0.995, 1.   , 0.995, 0.98 , 0.956, 0.923, 0.882, 0.835,\n        0.783, 0.726, 0.667, 0.607, 0.546, 0.487, 0.43 , 0.375, 0.325,\n        0.278, 0.236, 0.198, 0.164, 0.135, 0.11 , 0.089, 0.071, 0.056,\n        0.044, 0.034, 0.026, 0.02 , 0.015, 0.011, 0.008, 0.006, 0.004,\n        0.003, 0.002, 0.002, 0.001, 0.001, 0.   , 0.   , 0.   , 0.   ,\n        0.   , 0.   , 0.   , 0.   , 0.   , 0.   , 0.   , 0.   , 0.   ,\n        0.   , 0.   , 0.   , 0.   , 0.   , 0.   , 0.   , 0.   , 0.   ,\n        0.   , 0.   , 0.   , 0.   , 0.   , 0.   , 0.   , 0.   , 0.   ,\n        0.   , 0.   , 0.   , 0.   , 0.   , 0.   , 0.   , 0.   , 0.   ,\n        0.   , 0.   , 0.   , 0.   , 0.   , 0.   , 0.   , 0.   , 0.   ,\n        0.   , 0.   , 0.   , 0.   , 0.   , 0.   , 0.   , 0.   , 0.   ,\n        0.   ]])\n\n\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nplt.imshow(Sigma, cmap='hot', interpolation='nearest')\nplt.colorbar()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.11.4 Generation of Random Samples and Plotting the Realizations of the Random Function\nIn the context of the multivariate normal distribution, the next step is to utilize the previously constructed covariance matrix denoted as Sigma. It is used as an essential component in generating random samples from the multivariate normal distribution.\nThe function multivariate_normal is employed for this purpose. It serves as a random number generator specifically designed for the multivariate normal distribution. In this case, the mean of the distribution is set equal to mean, and the covariance matrix is provided as Psi. The argument size specifies the number of realizations, which, in this specific scenario, is set to one.\nBy default, the mean vector is initialized to zero. To match the number of samples, which is equivalent to the number of rows in the X and Sigma matrices, the argument zeros(n) is used, where n represents the number of samples (here taken from the size of the matrix, e.g.,: Sigma.shape[0]).\n\nrng = np.random.default_rng(seed=12345)\nY = rng.multivariate_normal(zeros(Sigma.shape[0]), Sigma, size = 1, check_valid=\"raise\").reshape(-1,1)\nY.shape\n\n(100, 1)\n\n\nNow we can plot the results, i.e., a finite realization of the random function \\(Y()\\) under a GP prior with a particular covariance structure. We will plot those X and Y pairs as connected points on an \\(x\\)-\\(y\\) plane.\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nplt.plot(X, Y)\nplt.title(\"Realization of Random Functions under a GP prior.\\n sigma2: {}\".format(sigma2[0]))\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.6: Realization of one random function under a GP prior. sigma2: 1.0\n\n\n\n\n\nrng = np.random.default_rng(seed=12345)\nY = rng.multivariate_normal(zeros(Sigma.shape[0]), Sigma, size = 3, check_valid=\"raise\")\nplt.plot(X, Y.T)\nplt.title(\"Realization of Three Random Functions under a GP prior.\\n sigma2: {}\".format(sigma2[0]))\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.7: Realization of three random functions under a GP prior. sigma2: 1.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.11.5 Properties of the 1d Example\n\n6.11.5.1 Several Bumps:\nIn this analysis, we observe several bumps in the \\(x\\)-range of \\([0,10]\\). These bumps in the function occur because shorter distances exhibit high correlation, while longer distances tend to be essentially uncorrelated. This leads to variations in the function’s behavior:\n\nWhen \\(x\\) and \\(x'\\) are one \\(\\sigma\\) unit apart, the correlation is \\(\\exp\\left(-\\sigma^2 / (2\\sigma^2)\\right) = \\exp(-1/2) \\approx 0.61\\), i.e., a relative high correlation.\n\\(2\\sigma\\) apart means correlation \\(\\exp(− 2^2 /2) \\approx 0.14\\), i.e., only small correlation.\n\\(4\\sigma\\) apart means correlation \\(\\exp(− 4^2 /2) \\approx 0.0003\\), i.e., nearly no correlation—variables are considered independent for almost all practical application.\n\n\n\n6.11.5.2 Smoothness:\nThe function plotted in Figure 6.6 represents only a finite realization, which means that we have data for a limited number of pairs, specifically 100 points. These points appear smooth in a tactile sense because they are closely spaced, and the plot function connects the dots with lines to create the appearance of smoothness. The complete surface, which can be conceptually extended to an infinite realization over a compact domain, is exceptionally smooth in a calculus sense due to the covariance function’s property of being infinitely differentiable.\n\n\n6.11.5.3 Scale of Two:\nRegarding the scale of the \\(Y\\) values, they have a range of approximately \\([-2,2]\\), with a 95% probability of falling within this range. In standard statistical terms, 95% of the data points typically fall within two standard deviations of the mean, which is a common measure of the spread or range of data.\n\nimport numpy as np\nfrom numpy import array, zeros, power, ones, exp, multiply, eye, linspace, mat, spacing, sqrt, arange, append, ravel\nfrom numpy.random import multivariate_normal\n\ndef build_Sigma(X, sigma2):\n    n = X.shape[0]\n    k = X.shape[1]\n    D = zeros((k, n, n))\n    for l in range(k):\n        for i in range(n):\n            for j in range(i, n):\n                D[l, i, j] = 1/(2*sigma2[l])*(X[i,l] - X[j,l])**2\n    D = sum(D)\n    D = D + D.T\n    return exp(-D)\n\ndef plot_mvn( a=0, b=10, sigma2=1.0, size=1, n=100, show=True):    \n    X = np.linspace(a, b, n, endpoint=False).reshape(-1,1)\n    sigma2 = np.array([sigma2])\n    Sigma = build_Sigma(X, sigma2)\n    rng = np.random.default_rng(seed=12345)\n    Y = rng.multivariate_normal(zeros(Sigma.shape[0]), Sigma, size = size, check_valid=\"raise\")\n    plt.plot(X, Y.T)\n    plt.title(\"Realization of Random Functions under a GP prior.\\n sigma2: {}\".format(sigma2[0]))\n    if show:\n        plt.show()\n\n\nplot_mvn(a=0, b=10, sigma2=10.0, size=3, n=250)\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.8: Realization of Random Functions under a GP prior. sigma2: 10\n\n\n\n\n\nplot_mvn(a=0, b=10, sigma2=0.1, size=3, n=250)\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.9: Realization of Random Functions under a GP prior. sigma2: 0.1"

    "text": "6.12 Kriging: Modeling Basics\n\n6.12.1 The Kriging Basis Function\n\\(k\\)-dimensional basis functions of the form \\[\n\\psi(\\vec{x}^{(i)}, \\vec{x}^{(j)}) = \\exp \\left( - \\sum_{l=1}^k \\theta_l | x_{l}^{(i)} - x_{l}^{(j)} | ^{p_l} \\right)\n\\] are used in a method known as Kriging. Note, \\(\\vec{x}^{(i)}\\) denotes the \\(k\\)-dim vector \\(\\vec{x}^{(i)}= (x_1^{(i)}, \\ldots, x_k^{(i)})^T\\).\nThe Kriging basis function is related to the 1-dim Gaussian basis function ( Equation 6.2), which is defined as \\[\n\\Sigma(\\vec{x}^{(i)}, \\vec{x}^{(j)}) = \\exp\\{ - || \\vec{x}^{(i)} - \\vec{x}^{(j)}||^2 / (2\\sigma^2) \\}.\n\\tag{6.3}\\]\nThere are some differences between Gaussian basis functions and Kriging basis functions:\n\nWhere the Gaussian basis function has \\(1/(2\\sigma^2)\\), the Kriging basis has a vector \\(\\theta = [\\theta_1, \\theta_2, \\ldots, \\theta_k]^T\\).\nThe \\(\\theta\\) vector allows the width of the basis function to vary from dimension to dimension.\nIn the Gaussian basis function, the exponent is fixed at 2, Kriging allows this exponent \\(p_l\\) to vary (typically from 1 to 2).\n\n\n\n6.12.2 The Correlation Coefficient\nIn a bivariate normal distribution, the covariance matrix and the correlation coefficient are closely related. The covariance matrix \\(\\Sigma\\) for a bivariate normal distribution is a \\(2\\times 2\\) matrix that looks like this:\n\\[\n\\Sigma =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\sigma_1^2 & \\sigma_{12}\\\\\n\\sigma_{21} & \\sigma_2^2\n\\end{pmatrix},\n\\] where \\(\\sigma_1^2\\) and \\(\\sigma_2^2\\) are the variances of \\(X_1\\) and \\(X_2\\), and \\(\\sigma_{12} = \\sigma_{21}\\) is the covariance between \\(X_1\\) and \\(X_2\\).\nThe correlation coefficient, often denoted as \\(\\rho\\), is a normalized measure of the linear relationship between two variables. It is calculated from the covariance and the standard deviations \\(\\sigma_1\\) and \\(\\sigma_2\\) (or the square roots of the variances) of \\(X_1\\) and \\(X_2\\) as follows: \\[\n\\rho = \\sigma_{12} / (\\sqrt{\\sigma_1^2} \\times \\sqrt{\\sigma_2^2}) = \\sigma_{12} / (\\sigma_1 \\times \\sigma_2).\n\\]\nSo we can express the correlation coefficient \\(\\rho\\) in terms of the elements of the covariance matrix \\(\\Sigma\\). It can be interpreted as follows: The correlation coefficient ranges from -1 to 1. A value of 1 means that \\(X_1\\) and \\(X_2\\) are perfectly positively correlated, a value of -1 means they are perfectly negatively correlated, and a value of 0 means they are uncorrelated. This gives the same information as the covariance, but on a standardized scale that does not depend on the units of \\(X_1\\) and \\(X_2\\).\n\n\n6.12.3 Covariance Matrix and Correlation Matrix\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCovariance and Correlation (taken from Forrester, Sóbester, and Keane (2008))\n\n\n\nCovariance is a measure of the correlation between two or more sets of random variables.\n\\[\n\\text{Cov}(X,Y) = E[(X - E[X])(Y - E[Y])] = E[XY] - E[X]E[Y]\n\\]\nFrom the covariance, we can derive the correlation\n\\[\n\\text{Corr}(X,Y) = \\frac{\\text{Cov}(X,Y)}{\\sqrt{\\text{Var}(X)\\text{Var}(Y)}} = \\frac{\\text{Cov}(X,Y)}{\\sigma_X\\sigma_Y}.\n\\tag{6.4}\\]\nFor a vector of random variables\n\\[\nY =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n(Y^{(l)}, \\ldots, Y^{(n)})\n\\end{pmatrix}^T\n\\]\nthe covariance matrix is a matrix of covariances between the random variables\n\\[\n\\Sigma =\n\\text{Cov}(Y, Y) =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\text{Cov}(Y^{(1)}, Y^{(1)}) & \\ldots & \\text{Cov}(Y^{(1)}, Y^{(n)}) \\\\\n\\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\\n\\text{Cov}(Y^{(n)}, Y^{(1)}) & \\ldots & \\text{Cov}(Y^{(n)}, Y^{(n)})\n\\end{pmatrix},\n\\]\nand from Equation 6.4\n\\[\n\\text{Cov}(Y, Y) = \\sigma_Y^2 \\text{Cor}(Y, Y).\n\\]\n\n\nYou can compute the correlation matrix \\(\\Psi\\) from a covariance matrix \\(\\Sigma\\) in Python using the numpy library. The correlation matrix is computed by dividing each element of the covariance matrix by the product of the standard deviations of the corresponding variables.\nThe function covariance_to_correlation first computes the standard deviations of the variables with np.sqrt(np.diag(cov)). It then computes the correlation matrix by dividing each element of the covariance matrix by the product of the standard deviations of the corresponding variables with cov / np.outer(std_devs, std_devs).\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef covariance_to_correlation(cov):\n    # Compute standard deviations\n    std_devs = np.sqrt(np.diag(cov))\n    \n    # Compute correlation matrix\n    corr = cov / np.outer(std_devs, std_devs)\n    \n    return corr\n\ncov = np.array([[9, -4], [-4, 9]])\nprint(covariance_to_correlation(cov))\n\n[[ 1.         -0.44444444]\n [-0.44444444  1.        ]]\n\n\n\n\n6.12.4 Building the Kriging Correlation Matrix\nConsider a set of \\(k\\)-dimensional sample data (sample size is \\(n\\)) \\[\nX = \\{\\vec{x}_1, \\vec{x}_2, \\ldots, \\vec{x}_n\\},\n\\] i.e., \\(X\\) is a \\((n,k)\\)-matrix, with related responses \\[\n\\vec{y} = \\{y_1, y_2, \\ldots, y_n\\}.\n\\] We are interested in finding an expression for the predicted value at a new point \\(\\vec{x}\\). We are going to interpret the observed responses as if they are generated by a stochastic process, which will be denoted as follows: \\[\nY = [Y(\\vec{x}_1), \\ldots, Y(\\vec{x}_n) ]^T.\n\\] The random process has a mean of \\(\\vec{\\mu}\\) (which is a \\((n \\times 1)\\)-dimensional vector).

    "text": "6.13 Kriging Modeling and Prediction in a Nutshell\nWe will use the Kriging correlation \\(\\Psi\\) to predict new values based on the observed data. The matrix algebra involved for calculating the likelihood is the most computationally intensive part of the Kriging process. Care must be taken that the computer code is as efficient as possible.\nBasic elements of the Kriging based surrogate optimization such as interpolation, expected improvement, and regression are presented. The presentation follows the approach described in Forrester, Sóbester, and Keane (2008) and Bartz et al. (2022).\n\n6.13.1 The Kriging Model\nConsider sample data \\(\\vec{X}\\) and \\(\\vec{y}\\) from \\(n\\) locations that are available in matrix form: \\(\\vec{X}\\) is a \\((n \\times k)\\) matrix, where \\(k\\) denotes the problem dimension and \\(\\vec{y}\\) is a \\((n\\times 1)\\) vector.\nThe observed responses \\(\\vec{y}\\) are considered as if they are from a stochastic process, which will be denoted as \\[\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\vec{Y}(\\vec{x}^{(1)})\\\\\n\\vdots\\\\\n\\vec{Y}(\\vec{x}^{(n)})\\\\\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n\\]\nThe set of random vectors (also referred to as a random field) has a mean of \\(\\vec{1} \\mu\\), which is a \\((n\\times 1)\\) vector.\n\n\n6.13.2 Correlations\nThe random vectors are correlated with each other using the basis function expression \\[\n\\text{cor} \\left(\\vec{Y}(\\vec{x}^{(i)}),\\vec{Y}(\\vec{x}^{(l)}) \\right) = \\exp\\left\\{ - \\sum_{j=1}^k \\theta_j |x_j^{(i)} - x_j^{(l)} |^{p_j}\\right\\}.\n\\]\nThe \\((n \\times n)\\) correlation matrix of the observed sample data is\n\\[\n\\vec{\\Psi} = \\begin{pmatrix}\n\\text{cor}\\left(\n\\vec{Y}(\\vec{x}^{(i)}),\n\\vec{Y}(\\vec{x}^{(l)})\n\\right) & \\ldots &\n\\text{cor}\\left(\n\\vec{Y}(\\vec{x}^{(i)}),\n\\vec{Y}(\\vec{x}^{(l)})\n\\right)\\\\\n\\vdots  & \\vdots &  \\vdots\\\\\n\\text{cor}\\left(\n\\vec{Y}(\\vec{x}^{(i)}),\n\\vec{Y}(\\vec{x}^{(l)})\n\\right)&\n\\ldots &\n\\text{cor}\\left(\n\\vec{Y}(\\vec{x}^{(i)}),\n\\vec{Y}(\\vec{x}^{(l)})\n\\right)\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n\\]\nNote: correlations depend on the absolute distances between sample points \\(|x_j^{(n)} - x_j^{(n)}|\\) and the parameters \\(p_j\\) and \\(\\theta_j\\).\nCorrelation is intuitive, because when two points move close together, then \\(|x_l^{(i)} - x_l| \\to 0\\) and \\(\\exp(-|x_l^{(i)} - x_l| \\to 1\\), points show very close correlation and \\(Y(x_l^{(i)}) = Y(x_l)\\).\n\\(\\theta\\) can be seen as a width parameter:\n\nlow \\(\\theta_j\\) means that all points will have a high correlation, with \\(Y(x_j)\\) being similar across the sample.\nhigh \\(\\theta_j\\) means that there is a significant difference between the \\(Y(x_j)\\)’s.\n\\(\\theta_j\\) is a measure of how active the function we are approximating is.\nHigh \\(\\theta_j\\) indicate important parameters, see Figure 6.10.\n\n\nvisualize_inverse_exp_squared_distance(5, 0, theta_values=[0.5, 1, 2.0])\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.10: Theta set to 1/2, 1, and 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.13.3 MLE to estimate \\(\\theta\\) and \\(p\\)\nWe know what the correlations mean, but how do we estimate the values of \\(\\theta_j\\) and where does our observed data \\(y\\) come in? To estimate the values of \\(\\vec{\\theta}\\) and \\(\\vec{p}\\), they are chosen to maximize the likelihood of \\(\\vec{y}\\), which can be expressed in terms of the sample data \\[L\\left(\\vec{Y}(\\vec{x}^{(1)}), \\ldots, \\vec{Y}(\\vec{x}^{(n)}) | \\mu, \\sigma \\right) = \\frac{1}{(2\\pi \\sigma)^{n/2} |\\vec{\\Psi}|^{1/2}} \\exp\\left\\{ \\frac{-(\\vec{y} - \\vec{1}\\mu)^T \\vec{\\Psi}^{-1}(\\vec{y} - \\vec{1}\\mu) }{2 \\sigma^2}\\right\\},\\] and formulated as the log-likelihood: \\[\\ln(L) = - \\frac{n}{2} \\ln(2\\pi \\sigma) - \\frac{1}{2} \\ln |\\vec{\\Psi}| \\frac{-(\\vec{y} - \\vec{1}\\mu)^T \\vec{\\Psi}^{-1}(\\vec{y} - \\vec{1}\\mu) }{2 \\sigma^2}.\\]\nOptimization of the log-likelihood by taking derivatives with respect to \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\sigma\\) results in \\[\\hat{\\mu} = \\frac{\\vec{1}^T \\vec{\\Psi}^{-1} \\vec{y}^T}{\\vec{1}^T \\vec{\\Psi}^{-1} \\vec{1}^T}\\] and \\[\\hat{\\sigma} = \\frac{(\\vec{y} - \\vec{1}\\mu)^T \\vec{\\Psi}^{-1}(\\vec{y} - \\vec{1}\\mu)}{n}.\\]\nCombining the equations leads to the concentrated log-likelihood: \\[\\ln(L) = - \\frac{n}{2} \\ln(\\hat{\\sigma}) - \\frac{1}{2} \\ln |\\vec{\\Psi}|. \\tag{6.5}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: The Concentrated Log-Likelihood\n\n\n\n\nThe first term in Equation 6.5 requires information about the measured point (observations) \\(y_i\\).\nTo maximize \\(\\ln(L)\\), optimal values of \\(\\vec{\\theta}\\) and \\(\\vec{p}\\) are determined numerically, because the equation is not differentiable.\n\n\n\n\n\n6.13.4 Tuning \\(\\theta\\) and \\(p\\)\nOptimizers such as Nelder-Mead, Conjugate Gradient, or Simulated Annealing can be used to determine optimal values for \\(\\theta\\) and \\(p\\). After the optimization, the correlation matrix is build with the optimized \\(\\theta\\) and \\(p\\) values. This is best (most likely) Kriging model for the given data \\(y\\). We will skip the optimization step here and use \\(\\theta = 1\\) and \\(p=2\\).\n\n\n6.13.5 Kriging Prediction\n\nMain idea for prediction:\n\nThe new \\(Y(\\vec{x})\\) should be consistent with the old sample data \\(X\\).\n\nFor a new prediction \\(\\hat{y}\\) at \\(\\vec{x}\\), the value of \\(\\hat{y}\\) is chosen so that it maximizes the likelihood of the sample data \\(\\vec{X}\\) and the prediction, given the (optimized) correlation parameter \\(\\vec{\\theta}\\) and \\(\\vec{p}\\) from above.\nThe observed data \\(\\vec{y}\\) is augmented with the new prediction \\(\\hat{y}\\) which results in the augmented vector \\(\\vec{\\tilde{y}} = ( \\vec{y}^T, \\hat{y})^T\\).\nA vector of correlations between the observed data and the new prediction is defined as\n\n\\[\n\\vec{\\psi} =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\text{cor}\\left(\n\\vec{Y}(\\vec{x}^{(1)}),\n\\vec{Y}(\\vec{x})\n\\right) \\\\\n\\vdots  \\\\\n\\text{cor}\\left(\n\\vec{Y}(\\vec{x}^{(n)}),\n\\vec{Y}(\\vec{x})\n\\right)\n\\end{pmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\vec{\\psi}^{(1)}\\\\\n\\vdots\\\\\n\\vec{\\psi}^{(n)}\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n\\]\nThe augmented correlation matrix is constructed as\n\\[\n\\tilde{\\vec{\\Psi}} =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\vec{\\Psi} & \\vec{\\psi} \\\\\n\\vec{\\psi}^T & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n\\]\nThe log-likelihood of the augmented data is \\[\n\\ln(L) = - \\frac{n}{2} \\ln(2\\pi) - \\frac{n}{2} \\ln(\\hat{\\sigma}^2) - \\frac{1}{2} \\ln |\\vec{\\hat{\\Psi}}| -  \\frac{(\\vec{\\tilde{y}} - \\vec{1}\\hat{\\mu})^T \\vec{\\tilde{\\Psi}}^{-1}(\\vec{\\tilde{y}} - \\vec{1}\\hat{\\mu})}{2 \\hat{\\sigma}^2}.\n\\]\nThe MLE for \\(\\hat{y}\\) can be calculated as \\[\n\\hat{y}(\\vec{x}) = \\hat{\\mu} + \\vec{\\psi}^T \\vec{\\tilde{\\Psi}}^{-1} (\\vec{y} - \\vec{1}\\hat{\\mu}).\n\\tag{6.6}\\]\n\n\n6.13.6 Properties of the Predictor\nThis Equation reveals two important properties of the Kriging predictor:\n\nBasis functions: The basis function impacts the vector \\(\\vec{\\psi}\\), which contains the \\(n\\) correlations between the new point \\(\\vec{x}\\) and the observed locations. Values from the \\(n\\) basis functions are added to a mean base term \\(\\mu\\) with weightings \\(\\vec{w} = \\vec{\\tilde{\\Psi}}^{(-1)} (\\vec{y} - \\vec{1}\\hat{\\mu})\\).\nInterpolation: The predictions interpolate the sample data. When calculating the prediction at the \\(i\\)th sample point, \\(\\vec{x}^{(i)}\\), the \\(i\\)th column of \\(\\vec{\\Psi}^{-1}\\) is \\(\\vec{\\psi}\\), and \\(\\vec{\\psi} \\vec{\\Psi}^{-1}\\) is the \\(i\\)th unit vector. Hence, \\(\\hat{y}(\\vec{x}^{(i)}) = y^{(i)}\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Sinusoid Function\n\n\n\nToy example in 1d where the response is a simple sinusoid measured at eight equally spaced \\(x\\)-locations in the span of a single period of oscillation.\n1. Calculating the Correlation Matrix \\(\\Psi\\)\nThe correlation matrix \\(\\Psi\\) is based on the pairwise squared distances between the input locations. Here we will use \\(n=8\\) sample locations and \\(\\theta\\) is set to 1.0.\n\nn = 8\nX = np.linspace(0, 2*np.pi, n, endpoint=False).reshape(-1,1)\n# theta should be an array (of one value, for the moment, will be changed later)\ntheta = np.array([1.0])\nPsi = build_Psi(X, theta)\n\nEvaluate at sample points\n\ny = np.sin(X)\n\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nplt.plot(X, y, \"bo\")\nplt.title(f\"Sin(x) evaluated at {n} points\")\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n2.

Predicting at New Locations\nWe would like to predict at \\(m = 100\\) new locations in the interval \\([0, 2\\pi]\\). The new locations are stored in the variable x.\n\nm = 100\nx = np.linspace(0, 2*np.pi, m, endpoint=False).reshape(-1,1)\npsi = build_psi(X, x, theta)\n\n(100, 8)\n\n\nComputation of the predictive equations.\n\nU = cholesky(Psi).T\none = np.ones(n).reshape(-1,1)\nmu = (one.T.dot(solve(U, solve(U.T, y)))) / one.T.dot(solve(U, solve(U.T, one)))\nf = mu * ones(m).reshape(-1,1) + psi.T.dot(solve(U, solve(U.T, y - one * mu)))\n\nTo compute \\(f\\), Equation 6.6 is used.\n4.

    "text": "7.5 Visualizing the Optimization and Hyperparameter Tuning Process with TensorBoard\nspotPython supports the visualization of the hyperparameter tuning process with TensorBoard. The following example shows how to use TensorBoard with spotPython.\nFirst, we define an “experiment name” to identify the hyperparameter tuning process. The experiment name is used to create a directory for the TensorBoard files.\n\nfrom spotPython.utils.file import get_experiment_name\nfrom spotPython.utils.init import fun_control_init\nfrom spotPython.utils.file import get_spot_tensorboard_path\n\nPREFIX = \"01\"\nexperiment_name = get_experiment_name(prefix=PREFIX)\nprint(experiment_name)\n\nfun_control = fun_control_init(\n    spot_tensorboard_path=get_spot_tensorboard_path(experiment_name))\n\n01_bartz09_2024-01-05_10-12-42\n\n\nSince the spot_tensorboard_path is defined, spotPython will log the optimization process in the TensorBoard files. The TensorBoard files are stored in the directory spot_tensorboard_path. We can pass the TensorBoard information to the Spot method via the fun_control dictionary.\n\nspot_tuner = spot.Spot(fun=fun,\n                   lower = np.array([-1]),\n                   upper = np.array([2]),\n                   fun_evals= 10,\n                   seed=123,\n                   show_models=False,\n                   design_control={\"init_size\": 5},\n                   fun_control=fun_control,)\nspot_tuner.run()\n\n&lt;spotPython.spot.spot.Spot at 0x2d7c95950&gt;\n\n\nNow we can start TensorBoard in the background. The TensorBoard process will read the TensorBoard files and visualize the hyperparameter tuning process. From the terminal, we can start TensorBoard with the following command:\ntensorboard --logdir=\"./runs\"\nlogdir is the directory where the TensorBoard files are stored. In our case, the TensorBoard files are stored in the directory ./runs.\nTensorBoard will start a web server on port 6006. We can access the TensorBoard web server with the following URL:\nhttp://localhost:6006/\nThe first TensorBoard visualization shows the objective function values plotted against the wall time. The wall time is the time that has passed since the start of the hyperparameter tuning process. The five initial design points are shown in the upper left region of the plot. The line visualizes the optimization process. \nThe second TensorBoard visualization shows the input values, i.e., \\(x_0\\), plotted against the wall time. \nThe third TensorBoard plot illustrates how spotPython can be used as a microscope for the internal mechanisms of the surrogate-based optimization process. Here, one important parameter, the learning rate \\(\\theta\\) of the Kriging surrogate is plotted against the number of optimization steps.\n\n\n\nTensorBoard visualization of the spotPython process."

Several objective functions allow one- or multidimensional input, some also combinations of real-valued and categorial input values.\nAn objective function is considered as “analytical” if it can be described by a closed mathematical formula, e.g., \\[\nf(x, y) = x^2 + y^2.\n\\]\nTo simulate measurement errors, adding artificial noise to the function value \\(y\\) is a common practice, e.g.,:\n\\[\nf(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 + \\epsilon.\n\\]\nUsually, noise is assumed to be normally distributed with mean \\(\\mu=0\\) and standard deviation \\(\\sigma\\). spotPython uses numpy’s scale parameter, which specifies the standard deviation (spread or “width”) of the distribution is used. This must be a non-negative value, see https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/random/generated/numpy.random.normal.html.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: The sphere function without noise\n\n\n\nThe default setting does not use any noise.\n\nfrom spotPython.fun.objectivefunctions import analytical\nfun = analytical().fun_sphere\nx = np.linspace(-1,1,100).reshape(-1,1)\ny = fun(x)\nplt.figure()\nplt.plot(x,y, \"k\")\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: The sphere function with noise\n\n\n\nNoise can be added to the sphere function as follows:\n\nfrom spotPython.fun.objectivefunctions import analytical\nfun = analytical(seed=123, sigma=0.02).fun_sphere\nx = np.linspace(-1,1,100).reshape(-1,1)\ny = fun(x)\nplt.figure()\nplt.plot(x,y, \"k\")\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n13.1.2 Reproducibility: Noise Generation and Seed Handling\nspotPython provides two mechanisms for generating random noise:\n\nThe seed is initialized once, i.e., when the objective function is instantiated. This can be done using the following call: fun = analytical(sigma=0.02, seed=123).fun_sphere.\nThe seed is set every time the objective function is called. This can be done using the following call: y = fun(x, sigma=0.02, seed=123).\n\nThese two different ways lead to different results as explained in the following tables:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Noise added to the sphere function\n\n\n\nSince sigma is set to 0.02, noise is added to the function:\n\nfrom spotPython.fun.objectivefunctions import analytical\nfun = analytical(sigma=0.02, seed=123).fun_sphere\nx = np.array([1]).reshape(-1,1)\nfor i in range(3):\n    print(f\"{i}: {fun(x)}\")\n\n0: [0.98021757]\n1: [0.99264427]\n2: [1.02575851]\n\n\nThe seed is set once. Every call to fun() results in a different value. The whole experiment can be repeated, the initial seed is used to generate the same sequence as shown below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Noise added to the sphere function\n\n\n\nSince sigma is set to 0.02, noise is added to the function:\n\nfrom spotPython.fun.objectivefunctions import analytical\nfun = analytical(sigma=0.02, seed=123).fun_sphere\nx = np.array([1]).reshape(-1,1)\nfor i in range(3):\n    print(f\"{i}: {fun(x)}\")\n\n0: [0.98021757]\n1: [0.99264427]\n2: [1.02575851]\n\n\n\n\nIf spotPython is used as a hyperparameter tuner, it is important that only one realization of the noise function is optimized. This behaviour can be accomplished by passing the same seed via the dictionary fun_control to every call of the objective function fun as shown below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: The same noise added to the sphere function\n\n\n\nSince sigma is set to 0.02, noise is added to the function:\n\nfrom spotPython.fun.objectivefunctions import analytical\nfun = analytical().fun_sphere\nfun_control = fun_control_init(\n    spot_tensorboard_path=get_spot_tensorboard_path(experiment_name),\n    sigma=0.02,\n    seed=123,)\ny = fun(x, fun_control=fun_control)\nx = np.array([1]).reshape(-1,1)\nfor i in range(3):\n    print(f\"{i}: {fun(x)}\")\n\n0: [0.98021757]\n1: [0.98021757]\n2: [0.98021757]"

    "title": "Appendix B — Git Introduction",
    "section": "B.2 Basics of Git",
    "text": "B.2 Basics of Git\n\nB.2.1 Initializing a Repository: git init\nTo set up Git as a version control system for your project, you need to initialize a new Git repository at the top-level folder, which is the working directory of your project. This is done using the git init command.\nAll files in this folder and its subfolders will automatically become part of the repository. Creating a Git repository is similar to adding an all-powerful passive observer of all things to your project. Git sits there, observes, and takes note of even the smallest changes, such as a single character in a file within a repository with hundreds of files. And it will tell you where these changes occurred if you forget. Once Git is initialized, it monitors all changes made within the working directory, and it tracks the history of events from that point forward. For this purpose, a historical timeline is created for your project, referred to as a “branch,” and the initial branch is named main. So, when someone says they are on the main branch or working on the main branch, it means they are in the historical main timeline of the project. The Git repository, often abbreviated as repo, is a virtual representation of your project, including its history and branches, a book, if you will, where you can look up and retrieve the entire history of the project: you work in your working directory, and the Git repository tracks and stores your work.\n\n\nB.2.2 Ignoring Files: .gitignore\nIt’s useful that Git watches and keeps an eye on everything in your project. However, in most projects, there are files and folders that you don’t need or want to keep an eye on. These may include system files, local project settings, libraries with dependencies, and so on.\nYou can exclude any file or folder from your Git repository by including them in the .gitignore file. In the .gitignore file, you create a list of file names, folder names, and other items that Git should not track, and Git will ignore these items. Hence the name “gitignore.” Do you want to track a file that you previously ignored? Simply remove the mention of the file in the gitignore file, and Git will start tracking it again.\n\n\nB.2.3 Adding Changes to the Staging Area: git add\nThe interesting thing about Git as an all-powerful, passive observer of all things is that it’s very passive. As long as you don’t tell Git what to remember, it will passively observe the changes in the project folder but do nothing.\nWhen you make a change to your project that you want Git to include in the project’s history to take a snapshot of so you can refer back to it later, your personal checkpoint, if you will, you need to first stage the changes in the staging area. What is the staging area? The staging area is where you collect changes to files that you want to include in the project’s history.\nThis is done using the git add command. You can specify which files you want to add by naming them, or you can add all of them using -A. By doing this, you’re telling Git that you’ve made changes and want it to remember these particular changes so you can recall them later if needed. This is important because you can choose which changes you want to stage, and those are the changes that will eventually be transferred to the history.\n\nNote: When you run git add, the changes are not transferred to the project’s history. They are only transferred to the staging area.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample of git add from the beginning\n\n\n\n# Create a new directory for your\n# repository and navigate to that directory:\n\nmkdir my-repo\ncd my-repo\n\n# Initialize the repository with git init:\n\ngit init\n\n# Create a .gitignore file for Python code.\n# You can use a template from GitHub:\n\ncurl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/gitignore/master/Python.gitignore -o .gitignore\n\n# Add your files to the repository using git add:\n\ngit add .\nThis adds all files in the current directory to the repository, except for the files listed in the .gitignore file.\n\n\n\n\nB.2.4 Transferring Changes to Memory: git commit\nThe power of Git becomes evident when you start transferring changes to the project history. This is done using the git commit command. When you run git commit, you inform Git that the changes in the staging area should be added to the history of the project so that they can be referenced or retrieved later.\nAdditionally, you can add a commit message with the -m option to explain what changes were made. So when you look back at the project history, you can see that you added a new feature.\ngit commit creates a snapshot, an image of the current state of your project at that specific time, and adds it to the branch you are currently working on.\nAs you work on your project and transfer more snapshots, the branch grows and forms a timeline of events. This means you can now look back at every transfer in the branch and see what your code looked like at that time.\nYou can compare any phase of your code with any other phase of your code to find errors, restore deleted code, or do things that would otherwise not be possible, such as resetting the project to a previous state or creating a new timeline from any point.\nSo how often should you add these commits? My rule of thumb is not to commit too often. It’s better to have a Git repository with too many commits than one with too few commits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContinuing the example from above:\n\n\n\nAfter adding your files with git add, you can create a commit to save your changes. Use the git commit command with the -m option to specify your commit message:\ngit commit -m \"My first commit message\"\nThis creates a new commit with the added files and the specified commit message.\n\n\n\n\nB.2.5 Check the Status of Your Repository: git status\nIf you’re wondering what you’ve changed in your project since the last commit snapshot, you can always check the Git status. Git will list every modified file and the current status of each file.\nThis status can be either:\n\nUnchanged (unmodified), meaning nothing has changed since you last transferred it, or\nIt’s been changed (changed) but not staged (staged) to be transferred into the history, or\nSomething has been added to staging (staged) and is ready to be transferred into the history.\n\nWhen you run git status, you get an overview of the current state of your project.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContinuing the example from above:\n\n\n\nThe git status command displays the status of your working directory and the staging area. It shows you which files have been modified, which files are staged for commit, and which files are not yet being tracked:\ngit status\ngit status is a useful tool to keep track of your changes and ensure that you have added all the desired files for commit.\n\n\n\n\nB.2.6 Review Your Repository’s History: git log\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContinuing the example from above:\n\n\n\nYou can view the history of your commits with the git log command. This command displays a list of all the commits in the current branch, along with information such as the author, date, and commit message:\ngit log\nThere are many options to customize the output of git log. For example, you can use the --pretty option to change the format of the output:\ngit log --pretty=oneline\nThis displays each commit in a single line."

    "text": "B.3 Branches (Timelines)\n\nB.3.1 Creating an Alternative Timeline: git branch\nIn the course of developing a project, you often reach a point where you want to add a new feature, but doing so might require changing the existing code in a way that could be challenging to undo later.\nOr maybe you just want to experiment and be able to discard your work if the experiment fails. In such cases, Git allows you to create an alternative timeline called a branch to work in.\nThis new branch has its own name and exists in parallel with the main branch and all other branches in your project.\nDuring development, you can switch between branches and work on different versions of your code concurrently. This way, you can have a stable codebase in the main branch while developing an experimental feature in a separate branch. When you switch from one branch to another, the code you’re working on is automatically reset to the latest commit of the branch you’re currently in.\nIf you’re working in a team, different team members can work on their own branches, creating an entire universe of alternative timelines for your project. When features are completed, they can be seamlessly merged back into the main branch.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContinuing the example from above:\n\n\n\nTo create a new branch, you can use the git branch command with the name of the new branch as an argument:\ngit branch my-tests\n\n\n\n\nB.3.2 The Pointer to the Current Branch: HEAD\nHow does Git know where you are on the timeline, and how can you keep track of your position?\nYou’re always working at the tip (HEAD) of the currently active branch. The HEAD pointer points there quite literally. In a new project archive with just a single main branch and only new commits being added, HEAD always points to the latest commit in the main branch. That’s where you are.\nHowever, if you’re in a repository with multiple branches, meaning multiple alternative timelines, HEAD will point to the latest commit in the branch you’re currently working on.\n\n\nB.3.3 Switching to an Alternative Timeline: git switch\nAs your project grows, and you have multiple branches, you need to be able to switch between these branches. This is where the switch command comes into play.\nAt any time, you can use the git switch command with the name of the branch you want to switch to, and HEAD moves from your current branch to the one you specified.\nIf you’ve made changes to your code before switching, Git will attempt to carry those changes over to the branch you’re switching to. However, if these changes conflict with the target branch, the switch will be canceled.\nTo resolve this issue without losing your changes, return to the original branch, add and commit your recent changes, and then perform the switch.\n\n\nB.3.4 Switching to an Alternative Timeline and Making Changes: git checkout\nTo switch between branches, you can also use the git checkout command. It works similarly to git switch for this purpose: you pass the name of the branch you want to switch to, and HEAD moves to the beginning of that branch.\nBut checkout can do more than just switch to another timeline. With git checkout, you can also move to any commit point in any timeline. In other words, you can travel back in time and work on code from the past.\nTo do this, use git checkout and provide the commit ID. This is an automatically generated, random combination of letters and numbers that identifies each commit. You can retrieve the commit ID using git log. When you run git log, you get a list of all the commits in your repository, starting with the most recent ones.\nWhen you use git checkout with an older commit ID, you check out a commit in the middle of a branch. This disrupts the timeline, as you’re actively attempting to change history. Git doesn’t want you to do that because, much like in a science fiction movie, altering the past might also alter the future. In our case, it would break the version control branch’s coherence.\nTo prevent you from accidentally disrupting time and altering history, checking out an earlier commit in any branch results in the warning “Detached Head,” which sounds rather ominous. The “Detached Head” warning is appropriate because it accurately describes what’s happening. Git literally detaches the head from the branch and sets it aside.\nNow, you’re working outside of time in a space unbound to any timeline, which again sounds rather threatening but is perfectly fine in reality.\nTo continue working on this past code, all you need to do is reattach it to the timeline. You can use git branch to create a new branch, and the detached head will automatically attach to this new branch.\nInstead of breaking the history, you’ve now created a new alternative timeline that starts in the past, allowing you to work safely. You can continue working on the branch as usual.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContinuing the example from above:\n\n\n\nTo switch to a new branch, you can use the git checkout command:\ngit checkout meine-tests\nNow you’re using the new branch and can make changes independently from the original branch.\n\n\n\n\nB.3.5 The Difference Between checkout and switch\nWhat is the difference between git switch and git checkout? git switch and git checkout are two different commands that both serve the purpose of switching between branches. You can use both to switch between branches, but they have an important distinction. git switch is a new command introduced with Git 2.23. git checkout is an older command that has existed since Git 1.6.0. So, git switch and git checkout have different origins. git switch was introduced to separate the purposes of git checkout. git checkout has two different purposes: 1. It can be used to switch between branches, and 2. It can be used to reset files to the state of the last commit.\nHere’s an example: In my project, I made a change since the last commit, but I haven’t staged it yet. Then, I realized that I actually don’t want this change. I want to reset the file to the state before the last commit. As long as I haven’t committed my changes, I can do this with git checkout by targeting the specific file. So, if that file is named main.js, I can say: git checkout main.js. And the file will be reset to the state of the last commit, which makes sense. I’m checking out the file from the last commit.\nBut that’s quite different from switching between the beginning of one branch to another. git switch and git restore were introduced to separate these two operations. git switch is for switching between branches, and git restore is for resetting the specified file to the state of the last commit. If you try to restore a file with git switch, it simply won’t work. It’s not intended for that. As I mentioned earlier, it’s about separating concerns.\n:::{.callout-note} #### Difference Between checkout and switch git checkout and git switch are both commands for switching between branches in a Git repository. The main difference between the two commands is that git switch is a newer command specifically designed for branch switching, while git checkout is an older command that can be used for various tasks, including branch switching.\nHere’s an example demonstrating how to initialize a repository and switch between branches:\n# Create a new directory for your repository\n# and navigate to that directory:\nmkdir my-repo\ncd my-repo\n\n# Initialize the repository with git init:\ngit init\n\n# Create a new branch with git branch:\ngit branch my-new-branch\n\n# Switch to the new branch using git switch:\ngit switch my-new-branch\n\n# Alternatively, you can also use git checkout\n# to switch to the new branch:\n\ngit checkout my-new-branch\nBoth commands lead to the same result: You are now on the new branch."

    "text": "B.4 Merging Branches and Resolving Conflicts\n\nB.4.1 git merge: Merging Two Timelines\nGit allows you to split your development work into as many branches or alternative timelines as you like, enabling you to work on many different versions of your code simultaneously without losing or overwriting any of your work.\nThis is all well and good, but at some point, you need to bring those various versions of your code back together into one branch. That’s where git merge comes in.\nConsider an example where you have two branches, a main branch and an experimental branch called experimental-branch. In the experimental branch, there is a new feature. To merge these two branches, you set HEAD to the branch where you want to incorporate the code and execute git merge followed by the name of the branch you want to merge. HEAD is a special pointer that points to the current branch. When you run git merge, it combines the code from the branch associated with HEAD with the code from the branch specified by the branch name you provide.\n# Initialize the repository\ngit init\n\n# Create a new branch called \"experimental-branch\"\ngit branch experimental-branch\n\n# Switch to the \"experimental-branch\"\ngit checkout experimental-branch\n\n# Add the new feature here and\n# make a commit\n# ...\n\n# Switch back to the \"main\" branch\ngit checkout main\n\n# Perform the merge\ngit merge experimental-branch\nDuring the merge, matching pieces of code in the branches overlap, and any new code from the branch being merged is added to the project. So now, the main branch also contains the code from the experimental branch, and the events of the two separate timelines have been merged into a single one. What’s interesting is that even though the experimental branch was merged with the main branch, the last commit of the experimental branch remains intact, allowing you to continue working on the experimental branch separately if you wish.\n\n\nB.4.2 Resolving Conflicts When Merging\nMerging branches where there are no code changes at the same place in both branches is a straightforward process. It’s also a rare process. In most cases, there will be some form of conflict between the branches – the same code or the same code area has been modified differently in the different branches. Merging two branches with such conflicts will not work, at least not automatically.\nIn this case, Git doesn’t know how to merge this code. So, when such a situation occurs, it’s marked as a conflict, and the merging process is halted. This might sound more dramatic than it is. When you get a conflict warning, Git is saying there are two different versions here, and Git needs to know which one you want to keep. To help you figure out the conflict, Git combines all the code into a single file and automatically marks the conflicting code as the current change, which is the original code from the branch you’re working on, or as the incoming change, which is the code from the file you’re trying to merge.\nTo resolve this conflict, you’ll edit the file to literally resolve the code conflict. This might mean accepting either the current or incoming change and discarding the other. It could mean combining both changes or something else entirely. It’s up to you. So, you edit the code to resolve the conflict. Once you’ve resolved the conflict by editing the code, you add the new conflict-free version to the staging area with git add and then commit the merged code with git commit. That’s how the conflict is resolved.\nA merge conflict occurs when Git struggles to automatically merge changes from two different branches. This usually happens when changes were made to the same line in the same file in both branches. To resolve a merge conflict, you must manually edit the affected files and choose the desired changes. Git marks the conflict areas in the file with special markings like &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;, =======, and &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;. You can search for these markings and manually select the desired changes. After resolving the conflicts, you can add the changes with git add and create a new commit with git commit to complete the merge.\nHere’s an example:\n# Perform the merge (this will cause a conflict)\ngit merge experimenteller-branch\n\n# Open the affected file in an editor and manually resolve the conflicts\n# ...\n\n# Add the modified file\ngit add &lt;filename&gt;\n\n# Create a new commit\ngit commit -m \"Resolved conflicts\"\n\n\nB.4.3 git revert: Undoing Something\nOne of the most powerful features of any software tool is the “Undo” button. Make a mistake, press “Undo,” and it’s as if it never happened. However, that’s not quite as simple when an all-powerful, passive observer is watching and recording your project’s history. How do you undo something that you’ve added to the history without rewriting the history?\nThe answer is that you can overwrite the history with the git reset command, but that’s quite risky and not a good practice.\nA better solution is to work with the historical timeline and simply place an older version of your code at the top of the branch. This is done with git revert. To make this work, you need to know the commit ID of the commit you want to go back to.\nThe commit ID is a machine-generated set of random numbers and letters, also known as a hash. To get a list of all the commits in the repository, including the commit ID and commit message, you can run git log.\n# Show the list of all operations in the repository\ngit log\nBy the way, it’s a good idea to leave clear and informative commit messages for this reason. This way, you know what happened in your previous commits. Once you’ve found the commit you want to revert to, call that commit ID with git revert, and then the ID. This will create a new commit at the top of the branch with the code from the reference commit. To transfer the code to the branch, add a commit message and save it. Now, the last commit in your branch matches the commit you’re reverting to, and your project’s history remains intact.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn example with git revert\n\n\n\n# Initialize a new repository\ngit init\n\n# Create a new file\necho \"Hello, World\" &gt; file.txt\n\n# Add the file to the repository\ngit add file.txt\n\n# Create a new commit\ngit commit -m \"First commit\"\n\n# Modify the file\necho \"Goodbye, World\" &gt; file.txt\n\n# Add the modified file\ngit add file.txt\n\n# Create a new commit\ngit commit -m \"Second commit\"\n\n# Use git log to find the commit ID of the second commit\ngit log\n\n# Use git revert to undo the changes from the second commit\ngit revert &lt;commit-id&gt;\n\n\nTo download the students branch from the repository git@git-ce.rwth-aachen.de:spotseven-lab/numerische-mathematik-sommersemester2023.git to your local machine, add a file, and upload the changes, you can follow these steps:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn example with git clone, git checkout, git add, git commit, git push\n\n\n\n# Clone the repository to your local machine:\ngit clone git@git-ce.rwth-aachen.de:spotseven-lab/numerische-mathematik-sommersemester2023.git\n\n# Change to the cloned repository:\ncd numerische-mathematik-sommersemester2023\n\n# Switch to the students branch:\ngit checkout students\n\n# Create the Test folder if it doesn't exist:\nmkdir Test\n\n# Create the Testdatei.txt file in the Test folder:\ntouch Test/Testdatei.txt\n\n# Add the file with git add:\ngit add Test/Testdatei.txt\n\n# Commit the changes with git commit:\ngit commit -m \"Added Testdatei.txt\"\n\n# Push the changes with git push:\ngit push origin students\nThis will upload the changes to the server and update the students branch in the repository."

    "text": "B.6 Advanced\n\nB.6.1 git rebase: Moving the Base of a Branch\nIn some cases, you may need to “rewrite history.” A common scenario is that you’ve been working on a new feature in a feature branch, and you realize that the work should have actually happened in the main branch.\nTo resolve this issue and make it appear as if the work occurred in the main branch, you can reset the experimental branch. “Rebase” literally means detaching the base of the experimental branch and moving it to the beginning of another branch, giving the branch a new base, thus “rebasing.”\nThis operation is performed from the branch you want to “rebase.” You use git rebase and specify the branch you want to use as the new base. If there are no conflicts between the experimental branch and the branch you want to rebase onto, this process happens automatically.\nIf there are conflicts, Git will guide you through the conflict resolution process for each commit from the rebase branch.\nThis may sound like a lot, but there’s a good reason for it. You are literally rewriting history by transferring commits from one branch to another. To maintain the coherence of the new version history, there should be no conflicts within the commits. So, you need to resolve them one by one until the history is clean. It goes without saying that this can be a fairly labor-intensive process. Therefore, you should not use git rebase frequently.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn example with git rebase\n\n\n\ngit rebase is a command used to change the base of a branch. This means that commits from the branch are applied to a new base, which is usually another branch. It can be used to clean up the repository history and avoid merge conflicts.\nHere is an example showing how to use git rebase:\n\nIn this example, we initialize a new Git repository and create a new file. We add the file to the repository and make an initial commit. Then, we create a new branch called “feature” and switch to that branch. We make changes to the file in the feature branch and create a new commit.\nThen, we switch back to the main branch and make changes to the file again. We add the modified file and make another commit.\nTo rebase the feature branch onto the main branch, we first switch to the feature branch and then use the git rebase command with the name of the main branch as an argument. This applies the commits from the feature branch to the main branch and changes the base of the feature branch.\n\n# Initialize a new repository\ngit init\n# Create a new file\necho \"Hello World\" &gt; file.txt\n# Add the file to the repository\ngit add file.txt\n# Create an initial commit\ngit commit -m \"Initial commit\"\n# Create a new branch called \"feature\"\ngit branch feature\n# Switch to the \"feature\" branch\ngit checkout feature\n# Make changes to the file in the \"feature\" branch\necho \"Hello Feature World\" &gt; file.txt\n# Add the modified file\ngit add file.txt\n# Create a new commit in the \"feature\" branch\ngit commit -m \"Feature commit\"\n# Switch back to the \"main\" branch\ngit checkout main\n# Make changes to the file in the \"main\" branch\necho \"Hello Main World\" &gt; file.txt\n# Add the modified file\ngit add file.txt\n# Create a new commit in the \"main\" branch\ngit commit -m \"Main commit\"\n# Use git rebase to rebase the \"feature\" branch\n# onto the \"main\" branch\ngit checkout feature\ngit rebase main"

To do this, download the current examination regulations for the Bachelor’s degree program in Electrical Engineering using the following command curl -o pruefungsordnung.pdf https://www.th-koeln.de/mam/downloads/deutsch/studium/studiengaenge/f07/ordnungen_plaene/f07_bpo_ba_ekb_2021_01_04.pdf.\nThe PDF file has been stored in the root directory of your repo and you must now exclude it from being uploaded so that no changes to this file are tracked. Please note that not only this one PDF file should be ignored, but all PDF files in the repo.\n\n\nB.8.2 Create file and stage it\nIn order to be able to commit a change later and thus make it traceable, it must first be staged.

To do this, open the file and simply change the character string in this file before saving the changes and closing the file. Before you now commit the file, you should reset the file to the status of the last commit for practice purposes and thus undo the change. After you have done this, open the file test.txt again and change the character string again before saving and closing the file. This time you should commit the file test.txt and then commit it with the message test-commit2.\n\n\nB.8.7 Merge branch into main\nAfter you have committed the change to the test.txt file, you should merge the change-text branch including the change into the main branch so that it is also available there.\n\n\nB.8.8 Resolve merge conflict\nTo simulate a merge conflict, you must first change the content of the test.txt file before you commit the change. Then switch to the branch change-text and change the file test.txt there as well before you commit the change. Now you should try to merge the branch change-text into the main branch and solve the problems that occur in order to be able to perform the merge successfully."

It uses the loss function specfied in fun_control and the metric specified in fun_control.\n\nFirst, the method HyperTorch().fun_torch is called.\nfun_torc(), which is implemented in the file hypertorch.py, calls evaluate_hold_out() as follows:\n\ndf_eval, _ = evaluate_hold_out(\n    model,\n    train_dataset=fun_control[\"train\"],\n    shuffle=self.fun_control[\"shuffle\"],\n    loss_function=self.fun_control[\"loss_function\"],\n    metric=self.fun_control[\"metric_torch\"],\n    device=self.fun_control[\"device\"],\n    show_batch_interval=self.fun_control[\"show_batch_interval\"],\n    path=self.fun_control[\"path\"],\n    task=self.fun_control[\"task\"],\n    writer=self.fun_control[\"writer\"],\n    writerId=config_id,\n)\nNote: Only the data set fun_control[\"train\"] is used for training and validation.
