Thus, we need to change the dimensionality of $x_{l}$ as well before adding to $F(x_{l})$. The original implementation used an identity mapping with stride 2 and padded additional feature dimensions with 0. However, the more common implementation is to use a 1x1 convolution with stride 2 as it allows us to change the feature dimensionality while being efficient in parameter and computation cost. The code for the ResNet block is relatively simple, and shown below:"
