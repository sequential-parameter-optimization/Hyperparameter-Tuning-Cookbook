        "Mathematical models implemented in computer codes are used to circumvent the need for expensive field data collection. These models are particularly useful when dealing with highly nonlinear response surfaces, high signal-to-noise ratios (which often involve deterministic evaluations), and a global scope. As a result, a new approach is required in comparison to Response Surface Methodology (RSM), which was discussed in @sec-rsm-intro.\n",
        "\n",
        "With the improvement in computing power and simulation fidelity, researchers gain higher confidence and a better understanding of the dynamics in physical, biological, and social systems. However, the expansion of configuration spaces and increasing input dimensions necessitates more extensive designs. High-performance computing (HPC) allows for thousands of runs, whereas previously only tens were possible. This shift towards larger models and training data presents new computational challenges.\n",
        "\n",
        "Research questions for DACE (Design and Analysis of Computer Experiments) include how to design computer experiments that make efficient use of computation and how to meta-model computer codes to save on simulation effort. The choice of surrogate model for computer codes significantly impacts the optimal experiment design, and the preferred model-design pairs can vary depending on the specific goal.\n",
        "\n",
        "The combination of computer simulation, design, and modeling with field data from similar real-world experiments introduces a new category of computer model tuning problems. The ultimate goal is to automate these processes to the greatest extent possible, allowing for the deployment of HPC with minimal human intervention.\n",
        "\n",
        "One of the remaining differences between RSM and DACE lies in how they handle noise. DACE employs replication, a technique that would not be used in a deterministic setting, to separate signal from noise. Traditional RSM is best suited for situations where a substantial proportion of the variability in the data is due to noise, and where the acquisition of data values can be severely limited. Consequently, RSM is better suited for a different class of problems, aligning with its intended purposes.\n",

        "* Using RSM: You would use RSM to design a series of experiments varying temperature and pressure. You would then fit a response surface (a mathematical model) to the data, helping you understand how changes in temperature and pressure affect yield. Using this model, you can identify optimal conditions for maximizing yield despite the noise.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Using DACE: If instead you use a computational model to simulate the chemical process and want to account for numerical noise or uncertainty in model parameters, you might use DACE. You would run simulations at different conditions, possibly repeating them to assess variability and build a surrogate model that accurately predicts yields, which can be optimized to find the best conditions.\n",

        "Noise in RSM: In experimental settings, noise often arises due to variability in experimental conditions, measurement errors, or other uncontrollable factors. This noise can significantly affect the response variable, $Y$. Replication is a standard procedure for handling noise in RSM.\n",
        "In the context of computer experiments, noise might not be present in the traditional sense since simulations can be deterministic. However, variability can arise from uncertainty in input parameters or model inaccuracies. DACE predominantly utilizes advanced interpolation to construct accurate models of deterministic data, sometimes considering statistical noise modeling if needed.\n",

Two common measures of such relationships are covariance and correlation. Covariance is a measure of how much two random variables change together. If the variables tend to show similar behavior (i.e., when one increases, the other tends to increase), the covariance is positive. Conversely, if they tend to move in opposite directions, the covariance is negative. \n",

In these cases, one could employ an LU-decomposition, though the result might be unreliable.
