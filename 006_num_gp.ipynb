        "Kriging  uses a specialized basis function that offers greater flexibility than standard RBFs. Examining @eq-krigingbase, we can observe how Kriging builds upon and extends the Gaussian basis concept. The key enhancements of Kriging over Gaussian RBF can be summarized as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Dimension-specific width parameters: While a Gaussian RBF uses a single width parameter $1/\\sigma^2$, Kriging employs a vector $\\vec{\\theta} = (\\theta_1, \\theta_2, \\ldots, \\theta_k)^T$. This allows the model to automatically adjust its sensitivity to each input dimension, effectively performing automatic feature relevance determination.\n",
        "* Flexible smoothness control: The Gaussian RBF fixes the exponent at 2, producing uniformly smooth functions. In contrast, Kriging's dimension-specific exponents $\\vec{p} = (p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_k)^T$ (typically with $p_j \\in [1, 2]$) enable precise control over smoothness properties in each dimension.\n",
        "* Unifying framework: When all exponents are set to $p_j = 2$ and all width parameters are equal ($\\theta_j = 1/\\sigma^2$ for all $j$), the Kriging basis function reduces exactly to the Gaussian RBF. This makes Gaussian RBF a special case within the more general Kriging framework.\n",
        "\n",
        "These enhancements make Kriging particularly well-suited for engineering problems where variables may operate at different scales or exhibit varying degrees of smoothness across dimensions.\n",

In these cases, one could employ an LU-decomposition, though the result might be unreliable.

To address this issue, it is advisable to calculate $\\ln(\\lvert\\Psi\\rvert)$ in @eq-concentrated-loglikelihood using twice the sum of the logarithms of the diagonal elements of the Cholesky factorization. This approach provides a more numerically stable method for computing the log-determinant, as the Cholesky decomposition $\\Psi = L L^T$ allows us to express $\\ln(\\lvert\\Psi\\rvert) = 2\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\ln(L_{ii})$, avoiding the direct computation of potentially very small determinant values.\n",
