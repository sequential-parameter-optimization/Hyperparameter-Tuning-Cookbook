        "Kriging  uses a specialized basis function that offers greater flexibility than standard RBFs. Examining @eq-krigingbase, we can observe how Kriging builds upon and extends the Gaussian basis concept. The key enhancements of Kriging over Gaussian RBF can be summarized as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Dimension-specific width parameters: While a Gaussian RBF uses a single width parameter $1/\\sigma^2$, Kriging employs a vector $\\vec{\\theta} = (\\theta_1, \\theta_2, \\ldots, \\theta_k)^T$. This allows the model to automatically adjust its sensitivity to each input dimension, effectively performing automatic feature relevance determination.\n",
        "* Flexible smoothness control: The Gaussian RBF fixes the exponent at 2, producing uniformly smooth functions. In contrast, Kriging's dimension-specific exponents $\\vec{p} = (p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_k)^T$ (typically with $p_j \\in [1, 2]$) enable precise control over smoothness properties in each dimension.\n",
        "* Unifying framework: When all exponents are set to $p_j = 2$ and all width parameters are equal ($\\theta_j = 1/\\sigma^2$ for all $j$), the Kriging basis function reduces exactly to the Gaussian RBF. This makes Gaussian RBF a special case within the more general Kriging framework.\n",
        "\n",
        "These enhancements make Kriging particularly well-suited for engineering problems where variables may operate at different scales or exhibit varying degrees of smoothness across dimensions.\n",

        "\n",
        "1.  **Covariance vs. Correlation:** Covariance is a measure of the joint variability of two random variables, while correlation is a standardized measure of this relationship, ranging from -1 to 1. The relationship between covariance and correlation for two random variables $X$ and $Y$ is given by $\\text{cor}(X, Y) = \\text{cov}(X, Y) / (\\sigma_X \\sigma_Y)$, where $\\sigma_X$ and $\\sigma_Y$ are their standard deviations.\n",
        "2.  **The Covariance Matrix $\\Sigma$:** The **covariance matrix $\\Sigma$** (or $\\text{Cov}(Y, Y)$ for the vector $\\vec{Y}$) captures the **pairwise covariances** between all elements of the vector of observed responses.\n",
        "3.  **Connecting $\\sigma^2$ and $\\Psi$ to $\\Sigma$:** In the Kriging framework described, the variance of each observation is often assumed to be constant, $\\sigma^2$. The covariance between any two observations $Y(\\vec{x}^{(i)})$ and $Y(\\vec{x}^{(l)})$ is given by $\\sigma^2$ multiplied by their correlation. That is, \n",

        "$$\n",
        "This relationship holds for *all* pairs of points. When expressed in matrix form, the covariance matrix $\\Sigma$ is the product of the variance $\\sigma^2$ (a scalar) and the correlation matrix $\\Psi$:\n",

        "\n",
        "So, $\\sigma^2$ tells us about the general spread or variability of the underlying process, while $\\Psi$ tells you *how* that variability is distributed and how strongly points are related to each other based on their positions. Together, they completely define the covariance structure of your observed data in the multivariate normal distribution used in Kriging.\n",

        "The matrix algebra necessary for calculating the likelihood is the most computationally intensive aspect of the Kriging process. It is crucial to ensure that the code implementation is as efficient as possible.\n",
        "\n",
        "Given that $\\Psi$ (our correlation matrix) is symmetric, only half of the matrix needs to be computed before adding it to its transpose. When calculating the log-likelihood, several matrix inversions are required. The fastest approach is to conduct one Cholesky factorization and then apply backward and forward substitution for each inverse.\n",
        "\n",
        "The Cholesky factorization is applicable only to positive-definite matrices, which $\\Psi$ generally is. However, if $\\Psi$ becomes nearly singular, such as when the $\\vec{x}^{(i)}$'s are densely packed, the Cholesky factorization might fail. In these cases, one could employ an LU-decomposition, though the result might be unreliable. When $\\Psi$ is near singular, the best course of action is to either use regression techniques or, as we do here, assign a poor likelihood value to parameters generating the near singular matrix, thus diverting the MLE search towards better-conditioned $\\Psi$ matrices.\n",
        "\n",
        "When working with correlation matrices, increasing the values on the main diagonal of a matrix will increase the absolute value of its determinant. A critical numerical consideration in calculating the concentrated log-likelihood is that for poorly conditioned matrices, $\\det(\\Psi)$ approaches zero, leading to potential numerical instability. To address this issue, it is advisable to calculate $\\ln(\\lvert\\Psi\\rvert)$ in @eq-concentrated-loglikelihood using twice the sum of the logarithms of the diagonal elements of the Cholesky factorization. This approach provides a more numerically stable method for computing the log-determinant, as the Cholesky decomposition $\\Psi = L L^T$ allows us to express $\\ln(\\lvert\\Psi\\rvert) = 2\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\ln(L_{ii})$, avoiding the direct computation of potentially very small determinant values.\n",
