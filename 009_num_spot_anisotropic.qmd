# Isotropic and Anisotropic Kriging {#sec-iso-aniso-kriging}

This chapter illustrates the difference between isotropic and anisotropic Kriging models. The difference is illustrated with the help of the `spotPython` package. Isotropic Kriging models use the same `theta` value for every dimension. Anisotropic Kriging models use different `theta` values for each dimension.

## Example: Isotropic `Spot` Surrogate and the 2-dim Sphere Function {#sec-spot-2d-sphere-iso}


```{python}
import numpy as np
from math import inf
from spotPython.fun.objectivefunctions import analytical
from spotPython.spot import spot
from spotPython.utils.init import fun_control_init, surrogate_control_init
PREFIX="003"
```

### The Objective Function: 2-dim Sphere

The `spotPython` package provides several classes of objective functions. We will use an analytical objective function, i.e., a function that can be described by a (closed) formula:

$$
f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2
$$
The size of the `lower` bound vector determines the problem dimension. Here we will use `np.array([-1, -1])`, i.e., a two-dimensional function.

```{python}
fun = analytical().fun_sphere
fun_control = fun_control_init(PREFIX=PREFIX,
                               lower = np.array([-1, -1]),
                               upper = np.array([1, 1]))
```

Although the default `spot` surrogate model is an isotropic Kriging model, we will explicitly set the `n_theta` parameter to a value of `1`, so that the same theta value is used for both dimensions.
This is done to illustrate the difference between isotropic and anisotropic Kriging models.

```{python}
surrogate_control=surrogate_control_init(n_theta=1)
```

```{python}
spot_2 = spot.Spot(fun=fun,
                   fun_control=fun_control,
                   surrogate_control=surrogate_control)

spot_2.run()
```

### Results

```{python}
spot_2.print_results()
```

```{python}
spot_2.plot_progress(log_y=True)
```

## Example With Anisotropic Kriging

As described in @sec-spot-2d-sphere-iso, the default parameter setting of `spotPython`'s Kriging surrogate uses the same `theta` value for every dimension. This is referred to as "using an isotropic kernel".  If different `theta` values are used for each dimension, then an anisotropic kernel is used. To enable anisotropic models in `spotPython`, the number of `theta` values should be larger than one. We can use `surrogate_control=surrogate_control_init(n_theta=2)` to enable this behavior (`2` is the problem dimension).

```{python}
surrogate_control = surrogate_control_init(n_theta=2)
spot_2_anisotropic = spot.Spot(fun=fun,
                    fun_control=fun_control,
                    surrogate_control=surrogate_control)
spot_2_anisotropic.run()
```

The search progress of the optimization with the anisotropic model can be visualized:

```{python}
spot_2_anisotropic.plot_progress(log_y=True)
```

```{python}
spot_2_anisotropic.print_results()
```

```{python}
spot_2_anisotropic.surrogate.plot()
```

### Taking a Look at the `theta` Values

#### `theta` Values from the `spot` Model

We can check, whether one or several `theta` values were used. The `theta` values from the surrogate can be printed as follows:

```{python}
spot_2_anisotropic.surrogate.theta
```

* Since the surrogate from the isotropic setting was stored as `spot_2`, we can also take a look at the `theta` value from this model:

```{python}
spot_2.surrogate.theta
```

#### TensorBoard

Now we can start TensorBoard in the background with the following command:



```{raw}
tensorboard --logdir="./runs"
```



We can access the TensorBoard web server with the following URL:



```{raw}
http://localhost:6006/
```



The TensorBoard plot illustrates how `spotPython` can be used as a microscope for the internal mechanisms of the surrogate-based optimization process. Here, one important parameter, the learning rate $\theta$ of the Kriging surrogate is plotted against the number of optimization steps.

## Exercises


###  `fun_branin`

* Describe the function.
  * The input dimension is `2`. The search range is  $-5 \leq x_1 \leq 10$ and $0 \leq x_2 \leq 15$.
* Compare the results from `spotPython` run a) with isotropic and b) anisotropic surrogate models.
* Modify the termination criterion: instead of the number of evaluations (which is specified via `fun_evals`), the time should be used as the termination criterion. This can be done as follows (`max_time=1` specifies a run time of one minute):

```{python}
fun_evals=inf,
max_time=1,
```

### `fun_sin_cos`

* Describe the function.
  *  The input dimension is `2`. The search range is  $-2\pi \leq x_1 \leq 2\pi$ and $-2\pi \leq x_2 \leq 2\pi$.
* Compare the results from `spotPython` run a) with isotropic and b) anisotropic surrogate models.
* Modify the termination criterion (`max_time` instead of `fun_evals`) as described for `fun_branin`.

###  `fun_runge`

###  `fun_wingwt`

* Describe the function.
  *  The input dimension is `10`. The search ranges are between 0 and 1 (values are mapped internally to their natural bounds).
