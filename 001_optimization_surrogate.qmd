# Introduction: Optimization

## Optimization, Simulation, and Surrogate Modeling

- We will consider the interplay between 
  + mathematical models, 
  + numerical approximation, 
  + simulation, 
  + computer experiments, and 
  + field data
- Experimental design will play a key role in our developments, but not in the classical regression and response surface methodology sense
- Challenging real-data/real-simulation examples benefiting from modern surrogate modeling methodology
- We will consider the classical, response surface methodology (RSM) approach, and then move on to more modern approaches
- All approaches are based on surrogates

## Surrogates

- Gathering data is **expensive**, and sometimes getting exactly the data you want is
impossible or unethical 
- **Surrogate**:  substitute for the real thing
- In statistics, draws from predictive equations derived from a fitted model can act as a
surrogate for the data-generating mechanism
- Benefits of the surrogate approach:
  - Surrogate could represent a cheaper way to explore relationships, and entertain "what ifs?" 
  - Surrogates favor faithful yet pragmatic reproduction of dynamics:
    - interpretation, 
    - establishing causality, or 
    - identification 
  - Many numerical simulators are **deterministic**, whereas field observations are
  noisy or have measurement error

### Costs of Simulation

- Computer simulations are generally cheaper (but not always!) than physical observation
- Some computer simulations can be just as expensive as field experimentation, but computer modeling is
regarded as easier because:
   - the experimental apparatus is better understood
   - more aspects may be controlled. 

### Mathematical Models and Meta-Models

- Use of mathematical models leveraging numerical solvers has been commonplace for some time 
- Mathematical models became more complex, requiring more resources to simulate/solve numerically
- Practitioners increasingly relied on **meta-models** built off of limited simulation campaigns 


### Surrogates = Trained Meta-models

- Data collected via expensive computer evaluations tuned flexible functional forms that could be used in lieu of further simulation to 
   - save money or computational resources; 
   - cope with an inability to perform future runs (expired licenses,  off-line or over-impacted supercomputers)
- Trained meta-models became known as **surrogates** 

### Computer Experiments

- **Computer experiment**: design, running, and fitting meta-models.
  - Like an ordinary statistical experiment, except the data are generated by computer codes rather than physical or field observations, or surveys 
- **Surrogate modeling** is statistical modeling of computer experiments
 

### Limits of Mathematical Modeling

- Mathematical biologists, economists and others had reached the limit of equilibrium-based mathematical modeling with
cute closed-form solutions
- **Stochastic simulations replace deterministic solvers** based on FEM, Navier--Stokes or Euler methods
- Agent-based simulation models are used to explore predator-prey (Lotka--Voltera) dynamics, spread of disease, management of inventory or patients in health insurance markets
- Consequence: the distinction between surrogate and statistical model is all but gone

### Example: Why Computer Simulations are Necessary

- You can't seed a real community with Ebola and watch what happens
- If there's (real) field data, say on a historical epidemic, further experimentation may be almost entirely limited to the mathematical and computer modeling side
-  Classical statistical methods offer little guidance

### Simulation Requirements

- Simulation should   
  - enable rich **diagnostics** to help criticize that models
  - **understanding** its sensitivity to inputs and other configurations
  - providing the ability to **optimize** and 
  - refine both **automatically** and with expert intervention 
- And it has to do all that while remaining **computationally tractable**
-  One perspective is so-called **response surface methods** (RSMs):
  - a poster child from industrial statistics' heyday, well before information technology became a dominant industry
