# Preface {.unnumbered}

The goal of hyperparameter tuning (or hyperparameter optimization) is to optimize the hyperparameters to improve the performance of the machine or deep learning model. 
 
spotPython ("Sequential Parameter Optimization Toolbox in Python") is the Python version of the well-known hyperparameter tuner SPOT, which has been developed in the R programming environment for statistical analysis for over a decade. The related open-access book is available here: [Hyperparameter Tuning for Machine and Deep Learning with R---A Practical Guide](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-981-19-5170-1).
 
[scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org) is a Python module for machine learning built on top of SciPy and is distributed under the 3-Clause BSD license. The project was started in 2007 by David Cournapeau as a Google Summer of Code project, and since then many volunteers have contributed.

[PyTorch](https://pytorch.org) is an optimized tensor library for deep learning using GPUs and CPUs. 

[River](https://riverml.xyz) is a Python library for online machine learning. It is designed to be used in real-world environments, where not all data is available at once, but streaming in.
